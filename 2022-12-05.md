## Waging wars with the big boys ~~despite the [Matthew effect](https://bigthink.com/politics-current-affairs/is-there-a-scientific-law-stating-that-inequality-is-a-fact-of-the-universe/)~~
[7 startup strategies for outcompeting the tech giants](https://www.goingviral.digital/blog-post/7-proven-strategies-for-tech-startup-to-compete-with-a-giant) 
A startup may not enjoy the benefits brought by vast resources of market leaders, yet it still can:
- Create a **blue ocean** for yourself/**pivoting** - a **subniche** usually [[10 Competitive Advantages Small Businesses Have Over Big Companies | ZenBusiness Inc.](https://businesstown.com/articles/david-vs-goliath-how-do-i-compete-with-larger-businesses/)];
- **Customer service**
	- _"A well-tuned small business can easily outperform its larger counterparts in customer service."_ (Shopkeeper's advantage);
	- **Building customer trust** by:
		- Respond quickly;
		- Act politely;
		- Reward customers for their loyalty;
		- Heed feedbacks;
		- Provide free info.
- Oil your **backend well so it can come out ahead** of the big boys's infrastructure. No one forbids you from using API/other building blocks!
- **Playing price wars by reducing them** with the Big Ones may prove dangerous and futile, but it's mentioned: if they set to really out you, getting a 0.1% breadwinner vertical at a slight loss for, say, 6 months isn't something impossible;
- **Cooperating and collaborating with the Gs** can bring value to both sides. Sharon Hadary has emphasized this in his post on WSJ where he stresses the importance of *“…identifying what your company can bring to the relationship that increases the success of both entities.”*;
- **Studying the Gs moves** and moving forward because of **less bureaucracy**;
- Instead of IMO useless *(1) They have advantages* from the OP, I'd add **"move faster"**. A small business is almost always able to buckle up and **win some hours/days.**

## [Shipping early](https://www.ycombinator.com/library/40-the-art-of-shipping-early-and-often) by YC
**Without shipping, you have no growth** -- and by definition, you are [not a startup](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html).
A number of psychological factors stop you from shipping: *pride, perfectionism, scope creep, fear of criticism, fear of rejection.*
### Work toward a v0, not a v1
The v0 is the **least amount of work** possible to say *“Hey, this is what I’m creating. What do you think?”*

### Work toward v0 features
Just as shipping early is essential to finding product/market fit, **releasing new features early is also essential to product/feature fit.**
With careful design and [Wizard of Oz](https://blog.ycombinator.com/ask-yc-upfront-technical-investments/) techniques you can often disguise minimal functionality while preserving resources.
**Downside**: your product will feel less mature and polished. 
**Upside**: feedback, data, and learning + iteration speed far outweighing the downs.
### Mini-demos
When anyone is working on a new feature, they can share an absurdly early version of it. Everyone can observe, and discuss.
MDs are:
- **Right direction before investing** significant time & resources, as it's easy to get off-track with many unknowns;
- A **diverse range of viewpoints** and needs into each feature’s design;
- A **regular drip feed of progress**, along with...
- Motivation to **build stuff** without **unnecessary work** like slide decks.
### Tips
*When in doubt about traction, three months with no distinct user growth is a reasonable warning flag that it’s time to try something else.*

[7 стратегий борьбы](https://www.goingviral.digital/blog-post/7-proven-strategies-for-tech-startup-to-compete-with-a-giant?utm_source=pocket_mylist) с крупными дядьками ~~эффектом Матвея~~

- Create a blue ocean for yourself/pivoting - a subniche usually [[10 Competitive Advantages Small Businesses Have Over Big Companies | ZenBusiness Inc.](https://businesstown.com/articles/david-vs-goliath-how-do-i-compete-with-larger-businesses/)];
- Customer service

	- **Building customer trust** by:

		- Heed feedbacks;
		- Provide free info.
- Oil your backend well so it can come out ahead of the big boys's infrastructure. Noone forbids you from using API/other building blocks!
- Playing price wars by reducing them with the Big Ones may prove dangerous and futile, but it's mentioned: if they set to really out you, getting a 0.1% breadwinner vertical at a slight loss for, say, 6 months isn't something impossible.

That feel when you report lower depression scores.

In an [article by Matthew Pierce et al. in _JAMA Psychiatry_](http://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.0609), 15 cohort studies with follow-up durations of 3-26 years (maybe more, but I'm a simple man I don't read) were reviewed to answer one question: **how much exercise is needed to stave off depression**?

**TL:DR** ‚Üí less than you thought.

## Real **TL:DR**
- Total **sample size**: 190,000 participants
- Exercise data was converted into [METs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_equivalent_of_task). *Spoiler*: sitting at a PC is 1.5/hour, sex is 5.8 (you're probably underdoing it), [saluting sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Salutation) is 7.4
- WHO recommends **30 min * 5 days/week of moderate activity, 8.8 METs** (NOT the [meth thing](https://t.me/ohmyboi/1046), however it may help...). 17 METs is being a fitness boss (or sitting at a PC, got ya).
- However, **4.4 METs per week had already yielded 18%** lower incidence of depression, yet 8.8 gave only 25% with high uncertainty. Going over that **didn't give substantional additional benefits**.

- Can't deny exercise has another benefits, e.g. crying in beautiful places ü§ó 2-in-1 bonus if [it's dangerous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_Falls)

# [The "Spice" Melange: Exercise, Capsaicin, Cannabinoids, and the Microbiome | annotated by Zakhar](https://readwise.io/reader/shared/01gn181emg303rqw3r92kgbhev)

Another day, another [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05525-z/).
## TL:DR
- The scientists tested the exercise abilities and motivation to run on some (~200) **genetically and metagenomically diverse** mice
- **There was no "athlete gene"**, nor a combination of them, so the authors turned out to other venues...
- And found it in microbiome, citing the post: *"I‚Äôve said before that, if you‚Äôre looking for a biological reason why two people are different along¬†**any**¬†axis, the microbiome is the logical place to start looking‚Äîeven before you check the genome."*
- Microbiome **was associated** with the differences (some were potatos, some were Rambos - one ran **30 miles over 2 days**) in exercise motivation, viz. _Coprococcus eutactus_¬†or¬†_Eubacterium rectale_
- The **differences were transferrable**, and FMT between fit fuckers ‚Üî lazyasses did transfer the motivation and capabilities
- Antibiotics did make things universally worse
- Abundance of _Ruminococcus_¬†was one of the strongest predictors of exercise performance, but mice **monocolonized with¬†_Ruminococcus gnavus_¬†actually did¬†_worse_¬†on the treadmill** than mice which had no bacteria at all
- The influence was mediated by **increased dopamine during exercise due to MAO-A inhibition**
- Citing: *"microbiome-depleted mice could have their exercise performance restored by feeding them capsaicin, a molecule that activates the¬†**TRPV1**¬†receptor. Capsaicin is the chemical found in chili peppers, responsible for the sensation of ‚Äúheat‚Äù when you eat spicy foods, and this feeling is **mediated by TRPV1**."*
![](https://i.imgur.com/UKAQ1GM.png)
- *"TRPV1-expressing neurons also **tend to express CB1 cannabinoid receptor CB1**, which gets its name because it‚Äôs activated by cannabinoids and related compounds. **The chemicals that gut bacteria produce to increase the dopamine released by exercise are cannabinoid agonists**‚Äîchemically similar to the endocannabinoids like anandamide that your brain produces on its own."*

Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, left) and Oleoylethanolamine (Right). OEA seems to [only act on PPAR-‚ç∫](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleoylethanolamide) though...
- Both Capsaicin and fatty acid amides **restore/increase the motivation to exercise, even after antibiotics**
## Action plan

A bit of, say, [PEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Fatty_acid_amides) sprinkled with nuts, fish and pepper...OK.

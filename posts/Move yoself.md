That feel when you report lower depression scores.

In an [article by Matthew Pierce et al. in _JAMA Psychiatry_](http://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.0609), 15 cohort studies with follow-up durations of 3-26 years (maybe more, but I'm a simple man I don't read) were reviewed to answer one question: **how much exercise is needed to stave off depression**?

**TL:DR** â‡’ less than you thought.

## Real **TL:DR**
- Total sample size: 190,000 participants
- Exercise data was converted into [METs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_equivalent_of_task). *Spoiler*: sitting at a PC is 1.5/hour, sex is 5.8 (you're probably underdoing it), [saluting sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Salutation) is 7.4
- WHO recommends 30 min * 5 days/week of moderate activity, 8.8 METs (NOT the [meth thing](https://t.me/ohmyboi/1046), however it may help...). 17 METs is being a fitness boss (or sitting at a PC, got ya).
- However, 4.4 METs per week yielded 18% lower incidence of depression, yet 8.8 gave only 25% with high uncertainty. Going over that didn't give additional benefits.

- Can't deny exercise has another benefits, e.g. crying in beautiful places ðŸ¤— 2-in-1 bonus if [it's dangerous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_Falls)

Another day, another [study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-05525-z/).
## TL:DR
- The scientists tested the exercise abilities and motivation to run on some (~200) **genetically and metagenomically diverse** mice
- **There was no "athlete gene"**, nor a combination of them, so the authors turned out to other venues...
- And found it in microbiome, citing the post: *"Iâ€™ve said before that, if youâ€™re looking for a biological reason why two people are different alongÂ **any**Â axis, the microbiome is the logical place to start lookingâ€”even before you check the genome."*
- Microbiome **was associated** with the differences (some were potatos, some were Rambos - one ran **30 miles over 2 days**) in exercise motivation, viz. _Coprococcus eutactus_Â orÂ _Eubacterium rectale_
- The **differences were transferrable**, and FMT between fit fuckers â†” lazyasses did transfer the motivation and capabilities
- Antibiotics did make things universally worse
- Abundance of _Ruminococcus_Â was one of the strongest predictors of exercise performance, but mice **monocolonized withÂ _Ruminococcus gnavus_Â actually didÂ _worse_Â on the treadmill** than mice which had no bacteria at all
- The influence

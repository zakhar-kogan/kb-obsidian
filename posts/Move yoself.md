That feel when you report lower depression scores.

In an [article by Matthew Pierce et al. in _JAMA Psychiatry_](http://doi.org/10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.0609), 15 cohort studies with follow-up durations of 3-26 years (maybe more, but I'm a simple man I don't read) were reviewed to answer one question: **how much exercise is needed to stave off depression**?

**TL:DR** â‡’ less than you thought.

## Real **TL:DR**
- Total sample size: 190,000 participants
- Exercise data was converted into [METs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolic_equivalent_of_task). *Spoiler*: sitting at a PC is 1.5/hour, sex is 5.8 (you're probably underdoing it), [saluting sun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Salutation) is 7.4
- WHO recommends 30 min * 5 days/week of moderate activity, 8.8 METs (NOT the [meth thing](https://t.me/ohmyboi/1046), however it may help...). 17 METs is being a fitness boss (or sitting at a PC, got ya).
- However, 4.4 METs per week yielded 18% lower incidence of depression, yet 8.8 gave only 25% with high uncertainty. Going over that didn't give additional benefits.

- Can't deny exercise has another benefits, e.g. crying in beautiful places ðŸ¤— 2-in-1 bonus if [it's dangerous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horseshoe_Falls)

## Money systems
Evolution of the monetary system:
- Object
- Gold/Silver/Bimetallism
- Bretton Woods
- Plaza Accord and Fiat

## Smart contracts
• Smart contracts are programmable financial instruments
• Ethereum provides Consensus as a Service (CaaS) so smart contracts are immutable
• Transactions are visible to all, so smart contracts are visible and auditable by all. This is simultaneously plus and minus
• Blockchain is permissionless, so anyone can write a smart contract
• In many situations, counterparty credit is not an issue since smart contracts are prefunded
• Consensus is VERY expensive
• Smart contracts require external oracles

## Ethereum
 •Ethereum (warts and all) can be viewed as a CaaS
provider, although it charges a lot for its services
• This aspect of Ethereum (or other blockchains which have
smart contract capabilities) can be used to build
Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications
• DeFi moves away from the centralized system to peer-to-
peer finance
• Typical DeFi vehicles:
• DAOs are decentralized autonomous organizations
• DEXs are decentralized exchanges
• Payments and stable coins
• Yield farming
• Tokenization
• Gaming
• Identity provision

## CBDC
• Potentially, central banks could issue digital cash
• CBDC opens way to a better monetary policy
• But also a possibility of pushing interest rates into a seriously negative territory and other controversial policies
• On the one hand, increasing tax collection, fighting crime, etc.
• On the other hand, excess control over ordinary citizens
• In principle, it would be possible to open a checking account at central bank directly, thus making retail banks obsolete
• In practice, it is more convenient to do by issuing licenses for narrow banks

## Conclusions
• Stock-flow consistent models are useful in describing the economy;
• These models show that money is created by commercial banks out of thin air when it is lent and destroyed when it is repaid;
• Recently, central banks started to play a bigger role in money creation;
• Digital Bretton Woods is needed;
Distributed ledger technology can help;
• Cryptocurrencies are interesting to watch but difficult to use;
• CBDCs are very appealing as a step into the digital economy;
• Stablecoins can play a similar role in the interim;
DeFi is a very promising development, although still relatively new and untested;
• Digital trade coins are needed for the multipolar world.

## Environment

- Divide actions for agents as act sense _ k
- True initial state, and i is in phi (i)
- We don't need observation, but we need belief states
- Belief state is a set of possible states
- Every sensing action we update the belief state
    

Uncertainty only about static things

- We eliminate everything not true every sensing action
    

## Agent projection

In multi agent, we may introduce sensing actions not needed if we're alone in the world: to check if conditions are satisfied before and after the action

Social laws are a way to reduce unnecessary sensing actions

- Projection is a tuple, solution is a policy
    
- Initial belief is phi_i
    

## Exec model

- Additional transition for sensing
    
- State of execution is plan + current belief
    
- Current belief may not match and it may invalidate other agents conditions
    
- No remaining plan in the model

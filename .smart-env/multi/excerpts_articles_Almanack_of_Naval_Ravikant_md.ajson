It cannot be [[outsourced]] or automated.":[11,11],"#quotes#Embrace [[accountability]], and take [[business]] [[risks]] under your own name. [[Society]] will [[reward]] you with responsibility, equity, and [[leverage]].":[12,12],"#quotes#Fortunes require [[leverage]]. [[Business]] leverage comes from [[capital]], people, and products with no marginal cost of replication ([[code]] and media).":[13,13],"#quotes#[[Capital]] means [[money]]. To raise money, apply your specific [[knowledge]] with [[accountability]] and show resulting good judgment.":[14,14],"#quotes#[[Labor]] means [[people]] working for you. It’s the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor [[leverage]] will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it.":[15,15],"#quotes#[[Capital]] and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing [[capital]], but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.":[16,16],"#quotes#[[Code]] and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the [[leverage]] behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.":[17,17],"#quotes#If you can’t [[code]], write [[books]] and blogs, record videos and podcasts.":[18,18],"#quotes#[[Judgment]] requires [[experience]] but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.":[19,19],"#quotes#[[Reading]] is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.":[20,20],"#quotes#You should be too busy to “do coffee” while still keeping an uncluttered [[calendar]].":[21,21],"#quotes#Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If [[outsourcing]] a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.":[22,22],"#quotes#[[Work]] as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work.":[23,23],"#quotes#Become the [[best]] in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.":[24,24],"#quotes#Apply specific [[knowledge]], with [[leverage]], and eventually you will get what you deserve.":[25,25],"#quotes#Your summary says “Productize yourself”—what does that mean? “Productize” and “yourself.” “Yourself” has uniqueness. “Productize” has [[leverage]]. “Yourself” has accountability. “Productize” has specific [[knowledge]]. “Yourself” also has specific knowledge in there. So all of these pieces, you can combine them into these two words.":[26,26],"#quotes#If you’re looking toward the long-term [[goal]] of getting wealthy, you should ask yourself, “Is this [[authentic]] to me? Is it myself that I am projecting?” And then, “Am I productizing it? Am I scaling it? Am I scaling with labor or with [[capital]] or with [[code]] or with media?” So it’s a very handy, simple [[mnemonic]].":[27,27],"#quotes#[[Technology]] democratizes consumption but consolidates [[production]]. The best person in the world at anything gets to do it for everyone.":[28,28],"#quotes#[[Society]] will pay you for creating things it wants. But society doesn’t yet know how to create those things, because if it did, they wouldn’t need you. They would already be stamped out.":[29,29],"#quotes#Almost everything in your house, in your workplace, and on the street used to be technology at one point in time. There was a time when oil was a technology that made J.D. Rockefeller rich. There was a time when cars were technology that made Henry Ford rich.":[30,30],"#quotes#Once something works, it’s no longer technology. Society always wants new things. And if you want to be wealthy, you want to figure out which one of those things you can provide for society that it does not yet know how to get but it will want and providing it is natural to you, within your skill set, and within your capabilities.":[31,31],"#quotes#When I talk about specific knowledge, I mean figure out what you were doing as a kid or teenager almost effortlessly. Something you didn’t even consider a skill, but people around you noticed. Your mother or your best friend growing up would know.":[32,32],"#quotes#Society, business, & money are downstream of technology, which is itself downstream of science. Science applied is the engine of humanity. Corollary: Applied Scientists are the most powerful people in the world. This will be more obvious in the coming years.":[33,33],"#quotes#There are other people to whom these things would be hard, and they say, “Well, how do I get good at being pithy and selling ideas?” Well, if you’re not already good at it or if you’re not really into it, maybe it’s not your thing—focus on the thing that you are really into.":[34,34],"#quotes#Specific knowledge is found much more by pursuing your innate talents, your genuine curiosity, and your passion. It’s not by going to school for whatever is the hottest job; it’s not by going into whatever field investors say is the hottest.":[35,35],"#quotes#The internet enables any niche interest, as long as you’re the best person at it to scale out. And the great news is because every human is different, everyone is the best at something—being themselves.":[36,36],"#quotes#“Escape competition through authenticity.” Basically, when you’re competing with people, it’s because you’re copying them. It’s because you’re trying to do the same thing. But every human is different. Don’t copy.":[37,37],"#quotes#The old model of making money is going to school for four years, getting your degree, and working as a professional for thirty years. But things change fast now. Now, you have to come up to speed on a new profession within nine months, and it’s obsolete four years later. But within those three productive years, you can get very wealthy.":[38,38],"#quotes#It’s much more important today to be able to become an expert in a brand-new field in nine to twelve months than to have studied the “right” thing a long time ago. You really care about having studied the foundations, so you’re not scared of any book. If you go to the library and there’s a book you cannot understand, you have to dig down and say, “What is the foundation required for me to learn this?” Foundations are super important.":[39,39],"#quotes#Basic arithmetic and numeracy are way more important in life than doing calculus. Similarly, being able to convey yourself simply using ordinary English words is far more important than being able to write poetry, having an extensive vocabulary, or speaking seven different foreign languages.":[40,40],"#quotes#You do need to be deep in something because otherwise you’ll be a mile wide and an inch deep and you won’t get what you want out of life. You can only achieve mastery in one or two things. It’s usually things you’re obsessed about.":[41,41],"#quotes#Intentions don’t matter. Actions do. That’s why being ethical is hard.":[42,42],"#quotes#When you find the right thing to do, when you find the right people to work with, invest deeply. Sticking with it for decades is really how you make the big returns in your relationships and in your money. So, compound interest is very important.":[43,43],"#quotes#When you’re dating, the instant you know this relationship is not going to be the one that leads to marriage, you should probably move on. When you’re studying something, like a geography or history class, and you realize you are never going to use the information, drop the class. It’s a waste of time. It’s a waste of your brain energy.":[44,44],"#quotes#The people who have the ability to fail in public under their own names actually gain a lot of power.":[45,45],"#quotes#Realize that in modern society, the downside risk is not that large. Even personal bankruptcy can wipe the debts clean in good ecosystems. I’m most familiar with Silicon Valley, but generally, people will forgive failures as long as you were honest and made a high-integrity effort.":[46,46],"#quotes#Without ownership, your inputs are very closely tied to your outputs. In almost any salaried job, even one paying a lot per hour like a lawyer or a doctor, you’re still putting in the hours, and every hour you get paid.":[47,47],"#quotes#Owning equity in a company basically means you own the upside. When you own debt, you own guaranteed revenue streams and you own the downside. You want to own equity. If you don’t own equity in a business, your odds of making money are very slim.":[48,48],"#quotes#We live in an age of infinite leverage, and the economic rewards for genuine intellectual curiosity have never been higher. Following your genuine intellectual curiosity is a better foundation for a career than following whatever is making money right now.":[49,49],"#quotes#Ironically, when you do things for their own sake, you create your best work. Even if you’re just trying to make money, you will actually be the most successful.":[50,50],"#quotes#The year I generated the most wealth for myself was actually the year I worked the least hard and cared the least about the future. I was mostly doing things for the sheer fun of it. I was basically telling people, “I’m retired, I’m not working.”":[51,51],"#quotes#You’re more likely to have skills society does not yet know how to train other people to do. If someone can train other people how to do something, then they can replace you. If they can replace you, then they don’t have to pay you a lot.":[52,52],"#quotes#If they can train you to do it, then eventually they will train a computer to do it.":[53,53],"#quotes#Think about what product or service society wants but does not yet know how to get. You want to become the person who delivers it and delivers it at scale. That is really the challenge of how to make money.":[54,54],"#quotes#The final form of leverage is brand new—the most democratic form. It is: “products with no marginal cost of replication.”":[55,55],"#quotes#As a worker, you want to be as leveraged as possible":[56,56],"#quotes#A leveraged worker can out-produce a non-leveraged worker by a factor of one thousand or ten thousand. With a leveraged worker, judgment is far more important than how much time they put in or how hard they work.":[57,57],"#quotes#Stay out of things that could cause you to lose all of your capital, all of your savings. Don’t gamble everything on one go. Instead, take rationally optimistic bets with big upsides.":[58,58],"#quotes#Demonstrated judgment—credibility around the judgment— is so critical. Warren Buffett wins here because he has massive credibility. He’s been highly accountable. He’s been right over and over in the public domain. He’s built a reputation for very high integrity, so you can trust him. People will throw infinite leverage behind him because of his judgment. Nobody asks him how hard he works. Nobody asks him when he wakes up or when he goes to sleep. They’re like, “Warren, just do your thing.”":[59,59],"#quotes#No one is going to value you more than you value yourself. You just have to set a very high personal hourly rate and you have to stick to it. Even when I was young, I just decided I was worth a lot more than the market thought I was worth, and I started treating myself that way.":[60,60],"#quotes#Another way of thinking about something is, if you can out-source something or not do something for less than your hourly rate, outsource it or don’t do it. If you can hire someone to do it for less than your hourly rate, hire them. That even includes things like cooking. You may want to eat your healthy home cooked meals, but if you can outsource it, do that instead.":[61,61],"#quotes#The business world has many people playing zero sum games and a few playing positive sum games searching for each other in the crowd.":[62,62],"#quotes#Because money is not going to solve all of your problems, but it’s going to solve all of your money problems.":[63,63],"#quotes#Status is a zero-sum game. It’s a very old game. We’ve been playing it since monkey tribes. It’s hierarchical. Who’s number one? Who’s number two? Who’s number three? And for number three to move to number two, number two has to move out of that slot. So, status is a zero-sum game.":[64,64],"#quotes#What is the most important thing to do for younger people starting out? Spend more time making the big decisions. There are basically three really big decisions you make in your early life: where you live, who you’re with, and what you do.":[65,65],"#quotes#You have to say no to everything and free up your time so you can solve the important problems. Those three are probably the three biggest ones.":[66,66],"#quotes#What are one or two steps you’d take to surround yourself with successful people? Figure out what you’re good at, and start helping other people with it. Give it away. Pay it forward. Karma works because people are consistent. On a long enough timescale, you will attract what you project. But don’t measure—your patience will run out if you count.":[67,67],"#quotes#An old boss once warned: “You’ll never be rich since you’re obviously smart, and someone will always offer you a job that’s just good enough.”":[68,68],"#quotes#FIND WORK THAT FEELS LIKE PLAY":[69,69],"#quotes#Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow. When today is complete, in and of itself, you’re retired.":[70,70],"#quotes#Money is not the root of all evil; there’s nothing evil about it. But the lust for money is bad. The lust for money is not bad in a social sense. It’s not bad in the sense of “you’re a bad person for lusting for money.” It’s bad for you. Lusting for money is bad for us because it is a bottomless pit. It will always occupy your mind. If you love money, and you make it, there’s never enough. There is never enough because the desire is turned on and doesn’t turn off at some number. It’s a fallacy to think it turns off at some number.":[71,71],"#quotes#You make money to solve your money and material problems. I think the best way to stay away from this constant love of money is to not upgrade your lifestyle as you make money. It’s very easy to keep upgrading your lifestyle as you make money. But if you can hold your lifestyle fixed and hopefully make your money in giant lump sums as opposed to a trickle at a time, you won’t have time to upgrade your lifestyle. You may get so far ahead you actually become financially free.":[72,72],"#quotes#I think the best way to stay away from this constant love of money is to not upgrade your lifestyle as you make money.

You may get so far ahead you actually become financially free. Another thing that helps: I value freedom above everything.":[73,73],"#quotes#The winners of any game are the people who are so addicted they continue playing even as the marginal utility from winning declines.":[74,74],"#quotes#For someone who is early in their career (and maybe even later), the single most important thing about a company is the alumni network you’re going to build. Think about who you will work with and what those people are going on to do.":[75,75],"#quotes#Just recently, Babak Nivi, my co-founder, and I were talking on Twitter about how one gets lucky, and there are really four kinds of luck we were talking about. The first kind of luck is blind luck where one just gets lucky because something completely out of their control happened. This includes fortune, fate, etc. Then, there’s luck through persistence, hard work, hustle, and motion. This is when you’re running around creating opportunities. You’re generating a lot of energy, you’re doing a lot to stir things up. It’s almost like mixing a petri dish or mixing a bunch of reagents and seeing what combines. You’re just generating enough force, hustle, and energy for luck to find you. A third way is you become very good at spotting luck. If you are very skilled in a field, you will notice when a lucky break happens in your field, and other people who aren’t attuned to it won’t notice. So, you become sensitive to luck. The last kind of luck is the weirdest, hardest kind, where you build a unique character, a unique brand, a unique mindset, which causes luck to find you.":[76,76],"#quotes#Ways to get lucky:":[77,84],"#quotes#Ways to get lucky:#{1}":[78,84],"#quotes#One of the things I think is important to make money is having a reputation that makes people do deals through you. Remember the example of being a great diver where treasure hunters will come and give you a piece of the treasure for your diving skills.":[85,86],"#quotes#My co-founder Nivi said, “In a long-term game, it seems that everybody is making each other rich. And in a short-term game, it seems like everybody is making themselves rich.” I think that is a brilliant formulation. In a long-term game, it’s positive sum. We’re all baking the pie together. We’re trying to make it as big as possible. And in a short-term game, we’re cutting up the pie.":[87,87],"#quotes#“In a long-term game, it seems that everybody is making each other rich. And in a short-term game, it seems like everybody is making themselves rich.”":[88,88],"#quotes#If someone is talking a lot about how honest they are, they’re probably dishonest. That is just a little telltale indicator I’ve learned. When someone spends too much time talking about their own values or they’re talking themselves up, they’re covering for something.":[89,89],"#quotes#The worst outcome in this world is not having self-esteem. If you don’t love yourself, who will?":[90,90],"#quotes#Everybody wants to get rich immediately, but the world is an efficient place; immediate doesn’t work. You do have to put in the time. You do have to put in the hours, and so I think you have to put yourself in the position with the specific knowledge, with accountability, with leverage, with the authentic skill set you have, to be the best in the world at what you do. You have to enjoy it and keep doing it, keep doing it, and keep doing it. Don’t keep track, and don’t keep count because if you do, you will run out of time.":[91,91],"#quotes#If you want to make the maximum amount of money possible, if you want to get rich over your life in a deterministically predictable way, stay on the bleeding edge of trends and study technology, design, and art—become really good at something.":[92,92],"#quotes#Hard work is really overrated. How hard you work matters a lot less in the modern economy. What is underrated? Judgment. Judgment is underrated.":[93,93],"#quotes#Can you define judgment? My definition of wisdom is knowing the long-term consequences of your actions. Wisdom applied to external problems is judgment. They’re highly linked; knowing the long-term consequences of your actions and then making the right decision to capitalize on that.":[94,94],"#quotes#In an age of leverage, one correct decision can win everything.":[95,95],"#quotes#Without hard work, you’ll develop neither judgment nor leverage.":[96,96],"#quotes#The direction you’re heading in matters more than how fast you move, especially with leverage. Picking the direction you’re heading in for every decision is far, far more important than how much force you apply. Just pick the right direction to start walking in, and start walking.":[97,97],"#quotes#I would rather understand the basics really well than memorize all kinds of complicated concepts I can’t stitch together and can’t rederive from the basics. If you can’t rederive concepts from the basics as you need them, you’re lost. You’re just memorizing.":[98,98],"#quotes#The number one thing clouding us from being able to see reality is we have preconceived notions of the way it should be.":[99,99],"#quotes#The hard thing is seeing the truth. To see the truth, you have to get your ego out of the way because your ego doesn’t want to face the truth. The smaller you can make your ego, the less conditioned you can make your reactions, the less desires you can have about the outcome you want, the easier it will be to see the reality.":[100,100],"#quotes#What you feel tells you nothing about the facts—it merely tells you something about your estimate of the facts.":[101,101],"#quotes#It’s actually really important to have empty space. If you don’t have a day or two every week in your calendar where you’re not always in meetings, and you’re not always busy, then you’re not going to be able to think.":[102,102],"#quotes#It’s only after you’re bored you have the great ideas. It’s never going to be when you’re stressed, or busy, running around or rushed. Make the time.":[103,103],"#quotes#Cynicism is easy. Mimicry is easy. Optimistic contrarians are the rarest breed.":[104,104],"#quotes#“Tension is who you think you should be. Relaxation is who you are.” —Buddhist saying":[105,105],"#quotes#It’s really important to be able to uncondition yourself, to be able to take your habits apart and say, “Okay, this is a habit I probably picked up when I was a toddler trying to get my parent’s attention. Now I’ve reinforced it and reinforced it, and I call it a part of my identity. Does it still serve me? Does it make me happier? Does it make me healthier? Does it make me accomplish whatever I set out to accomplish?”":[106,106],"#quotes#The classical virtues are all decision-making heuristics to make one optimize for the long term rather than for the short term.":[107,107],"#quotes#An old rule Warren Buffett has, which is praise specifically, criticize generally.":[108,108],"#quotes#If you have a criticism of someone, then don’t criticize the person—criticize the general approach or criticize the class of activities. If you have to praise somebody, then always try and find the person who is the best example of what you’re praising and praise the person, specifically. Then people’s egos and identities, which we all have, don’t work against you. They work for you.":[109,109],"#quotes#Charisma is the ability to project confidence and love at the same time.":[110,110],"#quotes#If you can be more right and more rational, you’re going to get nonlinear returns in your life.":[111,111],"#quotes#Evolution, thermodynamics, information theory, and complexity have explanatory and predictive power in many aspects of life.":[112,112],"#quotes#Julius Caesar famously said, “If you want it done, then go. And if not, then send.” What he meant was, if you want it done right, then you have to go yourself and do it.":[113,113],"#quotes#If you cannot decide, the answer is no. And the reason is, modern society is full of options. There are tons and tons of options. We live on a planet of seven billion people, and we are connected to everybody on the internet. There are hundreds of thousands of careers available to you. There are so many choices. You’re biologically not built to realize how many choices there are.":[114,114],"#quotes#Simple heuristic: If you’re evenly split on a difficult decision, take the path more painful in the short term.":[115,115],"#quotes#Reading a book isn’t a race—the better the book, the more slowly it should be absorbed.":[116,116],"#quotes#Explain what you learned to someone else. Teaching forces learning.":[117,117],"#quotes#Read the greats in math, science, and philosophy. Ignore your contemporaries and news. Avoid tribal identification. Put truth above social approval.":[118,118],"#quotes#When you’re reading a book and you’re confused, that confusion is similar to the pain you get in the gym when you’re working out. But you’re building mental muscles instead of physical muscles. Learn how to learn and read the books.":[119,119],"#quotes#Another way to do this is to read originals and read classics. If you’re interested in evolution, read Charles Darwin. Don’t begin with Richard Dawkins (even though I think he’s great). Read him later; read Darwin first. If you want to learn macroeconomics, first read Adam Smith, read von Mises, or read Hayek.":[120,120],"#quotes#When solving problems: the older the problem, the older the solution.":[121,121],"#quotes#A calm mind, a fit body, and a house full of love. These things cannot be bought. They must be earned.":[122,122],"#quotes#The three big ones in life are wealth, health, and happiness. We pursue them in that order, but their importance is reverse.":[123,123],"#quotes#Don’t take yourself so seriously. You’re just a monkey with a plan.":[124,124],"#quotes#Maybe happiness is not something you inherit or even choose, but a highly personal skill that can be learned, like fitness or nutrition.":[125,125],"#quotes#Happiness is there when you remove the sense of something missing in your life.":[126,126],"#quotes#If I say I’m happy, that means I was sad at some point. If I say he’s attractive, then somebody else is unattractive. Every positive thought even has a seed of a negative thought within it and vice versa, which is why a lot of greatness in life comes out of suffering. You have to view the negative before you can aspire to and appreciate the positive.":[127,127],"#quotes#If you ever want to have peace in your life, you have to move beyond good and evil.":[128,128],"#quotes#The world just reflects your own feelings back at you. Reality is neutral. Reality has no judgments. To a tree, there is no concept of right or wrong, good or bad. You’re born, you have a whole set of sensory experiences and stimulations (lights, colors, and sounds), and then you die. How you choose to interpret them is up to you—you have that choice.":[129,129],"#quotes#Can practicing meditation help you accept reality? Yeah. But it’s amazing how little it helps. [laughs] You can be a long-time meditator, but if someone says the wrong thing in the wrong way, you go back to your ego-driven self. It’s almost like you’re lifting one-pound weights, but then somebody drops a huge barbell with a stack of plates on your head. It’s absolutely better than doing nothing. But when the actual moment of mental or emotional suffering arrives, it’s still never easy. Real happiness only comes as a side-effect of peace. Most of it is going to come from acceptance, not from changing your external environment.":[130,130],"#quotes#We accept the voice in our head as the source of all truth. But all of it is malleable, and every day is new. Memory and identity are burdens from the past preventing us from living freely in the present.":[131,131],"#quotes#We crave experiences that will make us be present, but the cravings themselves take us from the present moment.":[132,132],"#quotes#“Enlightenment is the space between your thoughts.” It means enlightenment isn’t something you achieve after thirty years sitting on a mountaintop. It’s something you can achieve moment to moment, and you can be enlightened to a certain percent every single day.":[133,133],"#quotes#What if this life is the paradise we were promised, and we’re just squandering it?":[134,134],"#quotes#A happy person isn’t someone who’s happy all the time. It’s someone who effortlessly interprets events in such a way that they don’t lose their innate peace.":[135,135],"#quotes#We bought a new car. Now, I’m waiting for the new car to arrive. Of course, every night, I’m on the forums reading about the car. Why? It’s a silly object. It’s a silly car. It’s not going to change my life much or at all. I know the instant the car arrives I won’t care about it anymore. The thing is, I’m addicted to the desiring. I’m addicted to the idea of this external thing bringing me some kind of happiness and joy, and this is completely delusional.":[136,136],"#quotes#The fundamental delusion: There is something out there that will make me happy and fulfilled forever.":[137,137],"#quotes#Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.":[138,138],"#quotes#One thing I’ve learned recently: it’s way more important to perfect your desires than to try to do something you don’t 100 percent desire.":[139,139],"#quotes#Happiness is being satisfied with what you have. Success comes from dissatisfaction. Choose.":[140,140],"#quotes#If you could just sit for thirty minutes and be happy, you are successful. That is a very powerful place to be, but very few of us get there.":[141,141],"#quotes#In reality, peace is not a guarantee. It’s always flowing. It’s always changing. You want to learn the core skill set of flowing with life and accepting it in most cases.":[142,142],"#quotes#Whenever the word “should” creeps up in your mind, it’s guilt or social programming. Doing something because you “should” basically means you don’t actually want to do it. It’s just making you miserable, so I’m trying to eliminate as many “shoulds” from my life as possible.":[143,143],"#quotes#The enemy of peace of mind is expectations drilled into you by society and other people.":[144,144],"#quotes#Perhaps one reason why yoga and meditation are hard to sustain is they have no extrinsic value. Purely single-player games.":[145,145],"#quotes#Buffett has a great example when he asks if you want to be the world’s best lover and known as the worst, or the world’s worst lover and known as the best? [paraphrased] in reference to an inner or external scorecard.":[146,146],"#quotes#Jealousy was a very hard emotion for me to overcome. When I was young, I had a lot of jealousy. By and by, I learned to get rid of it. It still crops up every now and then. It’s such a poisonous emotion because, at the end of the day, you’re no better off with jealousy. You’re unhappier, and the person you’re jealous of is still successful or good-looking or whatever they are.":[147,147],"#quotes#There’s the “five chimps theory” where you can predict a chimp’s behavior by the five chimps it hangs out with the most. I think that applies to humans as well. Maybe it’s politically incorrect to say you should choose your friends very wisely. But you shouldn’t choose them haphazardly based on who you live next to or who you happen to work with. The people who are the most happy and optimistic choose the right five chimps.":[148,148],"#quotes#If you can’t see yourself working with someone for life, don’t work with them for a day.":[149,149],"#quotes#“Stop asking why and start saying wow.”":[150,150],"#quotes#Every time you catch yourself desiring something, say, “Is it so important to me I’ll be unhappy unless this goes my way?” You’re going to find with the vast majority of things it’s just not true.":[151,151],"#quotes#The more you judge, the more you separate yourself. You’ll feel good for an instant, because you feel good about yourself, thinking you’re better than someone. Later, you’re going to feel lonely. Then, you see negativity everywhere. The world just reflects your own feelings back at you.":[152,152],"#quotes#Tell your friends you’re a happy person. Then, you’ll be forced to conform to it. You’ll have a consistency bias. You have to live up to it. Your friends will expect you to be a happy person.":[153,153],"#quotes#The more secrets you have, the less happy you’re going to be.":[154,154],"#quotes#Hedonic adaptation is more powerful for man-made things (cars, houses, clothes, money) than for natural things (food, sex, exercise).":[155,155],"#quotes#A personal metric: how much of the day is spent doing things out of obligation rather than out of interest?":[156,156],"#quotes#Politics, academia, and social status are all zero-sum games. Positive-sum games create positive people.":[157,157],"#quotes#In any situation in life, you always have three choices: you can change it, you can accept it, or you can leave it.":[158,158],"#quotes#Pick one big desire in your life at any given time to give yourself purpose and motivation.":[159,159],"#quotes#Being peaceful comes from having your mind clear of thoughts. And a lot of clarity comes from being in the present moment. It’s very hard to be in the present moment if you’re thinking, “I need to do this. I want that. This has got to change.”":[160,160],"#quotes#Death is the most important thing that is ever going to happen to you. When you look at your death and you acknowledge it, rather than running away from it, it’ll bring great meaning to your life.":[161,161],"#quotes#There is no legacy. There’s nothing to leave. We’re all going to be gone. Our children will be gone. Our works will be dust. Our civilizations will be dust. Our planet will be dust. Our solar system will be dust. In the grand scheme of things, the Universe has been around for ten billion years. It’ll be around for another ten billion years. Your life is a firefly blink in a night. You’re here for such a brief period of time. If you fully acknowledge the futility of what you’re doing, then I think it can bring great happiness and peace because you realize this is a game. But it’s a fun game.":[162,162],"#quotes#Any moment where you’re not having a great time, when you’re not really happy, you’re not doing anyone any favors. It’s not like your unhappiness makes them better off somehow. All you’re doing is wasting this incredibly small and precious time you have on this Earth. Keeping death on the forefront and not denying it is very important.":[163,163],"#quotes#Number one priority in life, above my happiness, above my family, above my work, is my own health. It starts with my physical health. Second, it’s my mental health. Third, it’s my spiritual health. Then, it’s my family’s health. Then, it’s my family’s wellbeing. After that, I can go out and do whatever I need to do with the rest of the world.":[164,164],"#quotes#We have diets we are not evolved to eat. A correct diet should probably look closer to a paleo diet, mostly eating vegetables with a small amount of meat and berries.":[165,165],"#quotes#We’re probably evolved to use all of our five senses equally as opposed to favoring the visual cortex. In modern society, almost all of our inputs and communication are visual. We’re not meant to walk in shoes. A lot of back and foot problems come from shoes. We’re not meant to have clothes keep us warm all of the time. We’re meant to have some cold exposure. It kickstarts your immune system.":[166,166],"#quotes#We’re not meant to check our phone every five minutes. The constant mood swings of getting a “like” then an angry comment makes us into anxious creatures. We evolved for scarcity but live in abundance. There’s a constant struggle to say no when your genes always want to say yes. Yes to sugar. Yes to staying in this relationship. Yes to alcohol. Yes to drugs. Yes, yes, yes. Our bodies don’t know how to say no.":[167,167],"#quotes#When everyone is sick, we no longer consider it a disease.":[168,168],"#quotes#In nature, it’s very rare to find carbs and fat together. In nature, I find carbs and fat together in coconuts, in mangoes, maybe in bananas, but it’s basically tropical fruits. The combination of sugar and fat together is really deadly. You’ve got to watch out for that in your diet.":[169,169],"#quotes#Any sensible diet avoids the combination of sugar and fat together.":[170,170],"#quotes#Ironically, fasting (from a low-carb/paleo base) is easier than portion control. Once the body detects food, it overrides the brain.":[171,171],"#quotes#When it comes to medicine and nutrition, subtract before you add.":[172,172],"#quotes#World’s simplest diet: The more processed the food, the less one should consume.":[173,173],"#quotes#The harder the workout, the easier the day.":[174,174],"#quotes#“I don’t have time” is just another way of saying “It’s not a priority.”":[175,175],"#quotes#The best workout for you is one you’re excited enough to do every day.":[176,176],"#quotes#Like everything in life, if you are willing to make the short-term sacrifice, you’ll have the long-term benefit.":[177,177],"#quotes#Most of our suffering comes from avoidance. Most of the suffering from a cold shower is the tip-toeing your way in. Once you’re in, you’re in. It’s not suffering. It’s just cold. Your body saying it’s cold is different than your mind saying it’s cold.":[178,178],"#quotes#Meditation is intermittent fasting for the mind.":[179,179],"#quotes#Too much sugar leads to a heavy body, and too many distractions lead to a heavy mind. Time spent undistracted and alone, in self-examination, journaling, meditation, resolves the unresolved and takes us from mentally fat to fit.":[180,180],"#quotes#Life-hack: When in bed, meditate. Either you will have a deep meditation or fall asleep. Victory either way.":[181,181],"#quotes#Insight meditation lets you run your brain in debug mode until you realize you’re just a subroutine in a larger program.":[182,182],"#quotes#The ability to singularly focus is related to the ability to lose yourself and be present, happy, and (ironically) more effective.":[183,183],"#quotes#You are basically a bunch of DNA that reacted to environmental effects when you were younger. You recorded the good and bad experiences, and you use them to prejudge everything thrown against you. Then you’re using those experiences, constantly trying and predict and change the future.":[184,184],"#quotes#Meditation is turning off society and listening to yourself. It only “works” when done for its own sake. Hiking is walking meditation. Journaling is writing meditation. Praying is gratitude meditation. Showering is accidental meditation. Sitting quietly is direct meditation.":[185,185],"#quotes#The greatest superpower is the ability to change yourself.":[186,186],"#quotes#To have peace of mind, you have to have peace of body first.":[187,187],"#quotes#One of the things Krishnamurti talks about is being in an internal state of revolution. You should always be internally ready for a complete change. Whenever we say we’re going to try to do something or try to form a habit, we’re wimping out.":[188,188],"#quotes#Impatience with actions, patience with results.":[189,189],"#quotes#Anything you have to do, just get it done. Why wait? You’re not getting any younger. Your life is slipping away. You don’t want to spend it waiting in line. You don’t want to spend it traveling back and forth. You don’t want to spend it doing things you know ultimately aren’t part of your mission.":[190,190],"#quotes#Use your judgment to figure out what kinds of environments you can thrive in, and then create an environment around you so you’re statistically likely to succeed.":[191,191],"#quotes#If there’s something you want to do later, do it now. There is no “later.”":[192,192],"#quotes#I think almost everything that people read these days is designed for social approval.":[193,193],"#quotes#Everyone’s motivated at something. It just depends on the thing. Even the people that we say are unmotivated are suddenly really motivated when they’re playing video games. I think motivation is relative, so you just have to find the thing you’re into.":[194,194],"#quotes#Having the skill of persuasion is important because if you can influence your fellow human beings, you can get a lot done. I think persuasion is an actual skill. So you can learn it, and it’s not that hard to do so.":[195,195],"#quotes#You should know statistics and probability forwards and backwards and inside out.":[196,196],"#quotes#The hardest thing is not doing what you want—it’s knowing what you want.":[197,197],"#quotes#Advice to my younger self: “Be exactly who you are.”Holding back means staying in bad relationships and bad jobs for years instead of minutes.":[198,198],"#quotes#If you hurt other people because they have expectations of you, that’s their problem. If they have an agreement with you, it’s your problem. But, if they have an expectation of you, that’s completely their problem. It has nothing to do with you. They’re going to have lots of expectations out of life. The sooner you can dash their expectations, the better.":[199,199],"#quotes#Courage isn’t charging into a machine gun nest. Courage is not caring what other people think.":[200,200],"#quotes#Value your time. It is all you have. It’s more important than your money. It’s more important than your friends. It is more important than anything. Your time is all you have. Do not waste your time.":[201,201],"#quotes#Don’t spend your time making other people happy. Other people being happy is their problem. It’s not your problem. If you are happy, it makes other people happy. If you’re happy, other people will ask you how you became happy and they might learn from it, but you are not responsible for making other people happy.":[202,202],"#quotes#A busy mind accelerates the passage of subjective time.":[203,203],"#quotes#There is no endpoint to self-awareness and self-discovery. It’s a lifelong process you hopefully keep getting better and better at. There is no one meaningful answer, and no one is going to fully solve it unless you’re one of these enlightened characters.":[204,204],"#quotes#The real truths are heresies. They cannot be spoken. Only discovered, whispered, and perhaps read.":[205,205],"#quotes#You have to find your own meaning. Any piece of wisdom anybody else gives you, whether it’s Buddha or me, is going to sound like nonsense. Fundamentally, you have to find it for yourself, so the important part is not the answer, it’s the question. You just have to sit there and dig with the question. It might take you years or decades. When you find an answer you’re happy with, it will be fundamental to your life.":[206,206],"#quotes#There is no meaning to life. There is no purpose to life. Osho said, “It’s like writing on water or building houses of sand.” The reality is you’ve been dead for the history of the Universe, 10 billion years or more. You will be dead for the next 70 billion years or so, until the heat death of the Universe. Anything you do will fade. It will disappear, just like the human race will disappear and the planet will disappear. Even the group who colonizes Mars will disappear. No one is going to remember you past a certain number of generations, whether you’re an artist, a poet, a conqueror, a pauper, or anyone else. There’s no meaning.":[207,207],"#quotes#What kindof silly God judges you for eternity based on some small period of time here? I think after this life, it’s very much like before you were born. Remember that? It’s going to be just like that.":[208,208],"#quotes#The second law of thermodynamics states entropy only goes up, which means disorder in the Universe only goes up, which means concentrated free energy only goes down.":[209,209],"#quotes#The more complex system you create, whether it’s through computers, civilization, art, mathematics, or creating a family—you actually accelerate the heat death of the Universe. You’re pushing us towards this point where we end up as one thing.":[210,210],"#quotes#Anyone around whom I can’t be fully honest, I don’t want to be around.":[211,211],"#quotes#All benefits in life come from compound interest, whether in money, relationships, love, health, activities, or habits.

You can work in a restaurant eighty hours a week, and you’re not going to get rich. Getting rich is about knowing what to do, who to do it with, and when to do it.

But it has to be directed in the right way.":[225,225],"#quotes#If you don’t know yet what you should work on, the most important thing is to figure it out. You should not grind at a lot of hard work until you figure out what you should be working on.":[226,226],"#quotes#Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep.

If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.":[6,6],"#quotes#Arm yourself with specific [[knowledge]], [[accountability]], and [[leverage]].":[7,7],"#quotes#Specific [[knowledge]] is knowledge you cannot be trained for. If [[society]] can [[train]] you, it can train someone else and replace you.":[8,8],"#quotes#Specific [[knowledge]] is found by pursuing your genuine [[curiosity]] and [[passion]] rather than whatever is hot right now.":[9,9],"#quotes#Building specific [[knowledge]] will feel like play to you but will look like work to others.":[10,10],"#quotes#Specific [[knowledge]] is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be [[outsourced]] or automated.":[11,11],"#quotes#Embrace [[accountability]], and take [[business]] [[risks]] under your own name. [[Society]] will [[reward]] you with responsibility, equity, and [[leverage]].":[12,12],"#quotes#Fortunes require [[leverage]]. [[Business]] leverage comes from [[capital]], people, and products with no marginal cost of replication ([[code]] and media).":[13,13],"#quotes#[[Capital]] means [[money]]. To raise money, apply your specific [[knowledge]] with [[accountability]] and show resulting good judgment.":[14,14],"#quotes#[[Labor]] means [[people]] working for you. It’s the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor [[leverage]] will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it.":[15,15],"#quotes#[[Capital]] and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing [[capital]], but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.":[16,16],"#quotes#[[Code]] and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the [[leverage]] behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.":[17,17],"#quotes#If you can’t [[code]], write [[books]] and blogs, record videos and podcasts.":[18,18],"#quotes#[[Judgment]] requires [[experience]] but can be built faster by learning foundational skills.":[19,19],"#quotes#[[Reading]] is faster than listening. Doing is faster than watching.":[20,20],"#quotes#You should be too busy to “do coffee” while still keeping an uncluttered [[calendar]].":[21,21],"#quotes#Set and enforce an aspirational personal hourly rate. If fixing a problem will save less than your hourly rate, ignore it. If [[outsourcing]] a task will cost less than your hourly rate, outsource it.":[22,22],"#quotes#[[Work]] as hard as you can. Even though who you work with and what you work on are more important than how hard you work.":[23,23],"#quotes#Become the [[best]] in the world at what you do. Keep redefining what you do until this is true.":[24,24],"#quotes#Apply specific [[knowledge]], with [[leverage]], and eventually you will get what you deserve.":[25,25],"#quotes#Your summary says “Productize yourself”—what does that mean? “Productize” and “yourself.” “Yourself” has uniqueness. “Productize” has [[leverage]]. “Yourself” has accountability. “Productize” has specific [[knowledge]]. “Yourself” also has specific knowledge in there. So all of these pieces, you can combine them into these two words.":[26,26],"#quotes#If you’re looking toward the long-term [[goal]] of getting wealthy, you should ask yourself, “Is this [[authentic]] to me? Is it myself that I am projecting?” And then, “Am I productizing it? Am I scaling it? Am I scaling with labor or with [[capital]] or with [[code]] or with media?” So it’s a very handy, simple [[mnemonic]].":[27,27],"#quotes#[[Technology]] democratizes consumption but consolidates [[production]]. The best person in the world at anything gets to do it for everyone.":[28,28],"#quotes#[[Society]] will pay you for creating things it wants. But society doesn’t yet know how to create those things, because if it did, they wouldn’t need you. They would already be stamped out.":[29,29],"#quotes#Almost everything in your house, in your workplace, and on the street used to be technology at one point in time. There was a time when oil was a technology that made J.D. Rockefeller rich. There was a time when cars were technology that made Henry Ford rich.":[30,30],"#quotes#Once something works, it’s no longer technology. Society always wants new things. And if you want to be wealthy, you want to figure out which one of those things you can provide for society that it does not yet know how to get but it will want and providing it is natural to you, within your skill set, and within your capabilities.":[31,31],"#quotes#When I talk about specific knowledge, I mean figure out what you were doing as a kid or teenager almost effortlessly. Something you didn’t even consider a skill, but people around you noticed. Your mother or your best friend growing up would know.":[32,32],"#quotes#Society, business, & money are downstream of technology, which is itself downstream of science. Science applied is the engine of humanity. Corollary: Applied Scientists are the most powerful people in the world. This will be more obvious in the coming years.":[33,33],"#quotes#There are other people to whom these things would be hard, and they say, “Well, how do I get good at being pithy and selling ideas?” Well, if you’re not already good at it or if you’re not really into it, maybe it’s not your thing—focus on the thing that you are really into.":[34,34],"#quotes#Specific knowledge is found much more by pursuing your innate talents, your genuine curiosity, and your passion. It’s not by going to school for whatever is the hottest job; it’s not by going into whatever field investors say is the hottest.":[35,35],"#quotes#The internet enables any niche interest, as long as you’re the best person at it to scale out. And the great news is because every human is different, everyone is the best at something—being themselves.":[36,36],"#quotes#“Escape competition through authenticity.” Basically, when you’re competing with people, it’s because you’re copying them. It’s because you’re trying to do the same thing. But every human is different. Don’t copy.":[37,37],"#quotes#The old model of making money is going to school for four years, getting your degree, and working as a professional for thirty years. But things change fast now. Now, you have to come up to speed on a new profession within nine months, and it’s obsolete four years later. But within those three productive years, you can get very wealthy.":[38,38],"#quotes#It’s much more important today to be able to become an expert in a brand-new field in nine to twelve months than to have studied the “right” thing a long time ago. You really care about having studied the foundations, so you’re not scared of any book. If you go to the library and there’s a book you cannot understand, you have to dig down and say, “What is the foundation required for me to learn this?” Foundations are super important.":[39,39],"#quotes#Basic arithmetic and numeracy are way more important in life than doing calculus. Similarly, being able to convey yourself simply using ordinary English words is far more important than being able to write poetry, having an extensive vocabulary, or speaking seven different foreign languages.":[40,40],"#quotes#You do need to be deep in something because otherwise you’ll be a mile wide and an inch deep and you won’t get what you want out of life. You can only achieve mastery in one or two things. It’s usually things you’re obsessed about.":[41,41],"#quotes#Intentions don’t matter. Actions do. That’s why being ethical is hard.":[42,42],"#quotes#When you find the right thing to do, when you find the right people to work with, invest deeply. Sticking with it for decades is really how you make the big returns in your relationships and in your money. So, compound interest is very important.":[43,43],"#quotes#When you’re dating, the instant you know this relationship is not going to be the one that leads to marriage, you should probably move on. When you’re studying something, like a geography or history class, and you realize you are never going to use the information, drop the class. It’s a waste of time. It’s a waste of your brain energy.":[44,44],"#quotes#The people who have the ability to fail in public under their own names actually gain a lot of power.":[45,45],"#quotes#Realize that in modern society, the downside risk is not that large. Even personal bankruptcy can wipe the debts clean in good ecosystems. I’m most familiar with Silicon Valley, but generally, people will forgive failures as long as you were honest and made a high-integrity effort.":[46,46],"#quotes#Without ownership, your inputs are very closely tied to your outputs. In almost any salaried job, even one paying a lot per hour like a lawyer or a doctor, you’re still putting in the hours, and every hour you get paid.":[47,47],"#quotes#Owning equity in a company basically means you own the upside. When you own debt, you own guaranteed revenue streams and you own the downside. You want to own equity. If you don’t own equity in a business, your odds of making money are very slim.":[48,48],"#quotes#We live in an age of infinite leverage, and the economic rewards for genuine intellectual curiosity have never been higher. Following your genuine intellectual curiosity is a better foundation for a career than following whatever is making money right now.":[49,49],"#quotes#Ironically, when you do things for their own sake, you create your best work. Even if you’re just trying to make money, you will actually be the most successful.":[50,50],"#quotes#The year I generated the most wealth for myself was actually the year I worked the least hard and cared the least about the future. I was mostly doing things for the sheer fun of it. I was basically telling people, “I’m retired, I’m not working.”":[51,51],"#quotes#You’re more likely to have skills society does not yet know how to train other people to do. If someone can train other people how to do something, then they can replace you. If they can replace you, then they don’t have to pay you a lot.":[52,52],"#quotes#If they can train you to do it, then eventually they will train a computer to do it.":[53,53],"#quotes#Think about what product or service society wants but does not yet know how to get. You want to become the person who delivers it and delivers it at scale.

You’re generating a lot of energy, you’re doing a lot to stir things up. It’s almost like mixing a petri dish or mixing a bunch of reagents and seeing what combines. You’re just generating enough force, hustle, and energy for luck to find you. A third way is you become very good at spotting luck. If you are very skilled in a field, you will notice when a lucky break happens in your field, and other people who aren’t attuned to it won’t notice. So, you become sensitive to luck.

It’s not your problem. If you are happy, it makes other people happy. If you’re happy, other people will ask you how you became happy and they might learn from it, but you are not responsible for making other people happy.":[202,202],"#quotes#A busy mind accelerates the passage of subjective time.":[203,203],"#quotes#There is no endpoint to self-awareness and self-discovery. It’s a lifelong process you hopefully keep getting better and better at. There is no one meaningful answer, and no one is going to fully solve it unless you’re one of these enlightened characters.":[204,204],"#quotes#The real truths are heresies. They cannot be spoken. Only discovered, whispered, and perhaps read.":[205,205],"#quotes#You have to find your own meaning. Any piece of wisdom anybody else gives you, whether it’s Buddha or me, is going to sound like nonsense. Fundamentally, you have to find it for yourself, so the important part is not the answer, it’s the question. You just have to sit there and dig with the question. It might take you years or decades. When you find an answer you’re happy with, it will be fundamental to your life.":[206,206],"#quotes#There is no meaning to life. There is no purpose to life. Osho said, “It’s like writing on water or building houses of sand.” The reality is you’ve been dead for the history of the Universe, 10 billion years or more. You will be dead for the next 70 billion years or so, until the heat death of the Universe. Anything you do will fade. It will disappear, just like the human race will disappear and the planet will disappear. Even the group who colonizes Mars will disappear. No one is going to remember you past a certain number of generations, whether you’re an artist, a poet, a conqueror, a pauper, or anyone else. There’s no meaning.":[207,207],"#quotes#What kindof silly God judges you for eternity based on some small period of time here? I think after this life, it’s very much like before you were born. Remember that? It’s going to be just like that.":[208,208],"#quotes#The second law of thermodynamics states entropy only goes up, which means disorder in the Universe only goes up, which means concentrated free energy only goes down.":[209,209],"#quotes#The more complex system you create, whether it’s through computers, civilization, art, mathematics, or creating a family—you actually accelerate the heat death of the Universe. You’re pushing us towards this point where we end up as one thing.":[210,210],"#quotes#Anyone around whom I can’t be fully honest, I don’t want to be around.":[211,211],"#quotes#All benefits in life come from compound interest, whether in money, relationships, love, health, activities, or habits. I only want to be around people I know I’m going to be around for the rest of my life. I only want to work on things I know have long-term payout.":[212,212],"#quotes#Buddhist saying, “Anger is a hot coal you hold in your hand while waiting to throw it at somebody.”":[213,213],"#quotes#Much of finding great relationships, great coworkers, great lovers,wives, husbands, is finding other people where your values line up. If your values line up, the little things don’t matter.":[214,214],"#quotes#As investor Charlie Munger says, “To find a worthy mate, be worthy of a worthy mate.”":[215,215],"#quotes#Try everything, test it for yourself, be skeptical, keep what’s useful, and discard what’s not.":[216,216],"#quotes#Everyone starts out innocent. Everyone is corrupted. Wisdom is the discarding of vices and the return to virtue, by way of knowledge.":[217,217],"#quotes#If wisdom could be imparted through words alone, we’d all be done here.":[218,218],"#quotes#There is actually nothing but this moment. No one has ever gone back in time, and no one has ever been able to successfully predict the future in any way that matters. Literally, the only thing that exists is this exact point where you are in space at the exact time you happen to be here.":[219,219],"#quotes#You’re dying and being reborn at every moment. It’s up to you whether to forget or remember that.":[220,220],"#quotes#“Everything is more beautiful because we’re doomed. You will never be lovelier than you are now, and we will never be here again.” —Homer, The Iliad":[221,221],"#quotes#Inspiration is perishable—act on it immediately.":[222,222],"#quotes#If you have nothing in your life, but you have at least one person that loves you unconditionally, it’ll do wonders for your self-esteem.":[223,223],"#quotes#Books make for great friends, because the best thinkers of the last few thousand years tell you their nuggets of wisdom.":[224,224],"#quotes#It’s not really about hard work. You can work in a restaurant eighty hours a week, and you’re not going to get rich. Getting rich is about knowing what to do, who to do it with, and when to do it. It is much more about understanding than purely hard work. Yes, hard work matters, and you can’t skimp on it. But it has to be directed in the right way.":[225,225],"#quotes#If you don’t know yet what you should work on, the most important thing is to figure it out. You should not grind at a lot of hard work until you figure out what you should be working on.":[226,226],"#quotes#Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy.":[227,227],"#quotes#Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games.":[228,228],"#quotes#You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity—a piece of a business—to gain your financial freedom.":[229,229],"#quotes#You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale.":[230,230],"#quotes#Pick an industry where you can play long-term games with long-term people.":[231,231],"#quotes#Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest.":[232,232]},"last_import":{"mtime":1670935784602,"size":44613,"at":0,"hash":"5cf41e9a60846223eed3ca3161c9033d7444283a9eb411297465812960a49bb7"}},"smart_blocks:excerpts articles/Almanack of

"smart_blocks:excerpts articles/Almanack of Naval Ravikant.md#quotes#Demonstrated judgment—credibility around the judgment— is so critical. Warren Buffett wins here because he has massive credibility. He’s been highly accountable. He’s been right over and over in the public domain.

"smart_blocks:excerpts articles/Almanack of Naval Ravikant.md#quotes#Money is not the root of all evil; there’s nothing evil about it. But the lust for money is bad. The lust for money is not bad in a social sense. It’s not bad in the sense of “you’re a bad person for lusting for money.” It’s bad for you. Lusting for money is bad for us because it is a bottomless pit. It will always occupy your mind. If you love money, and you make it, there’s never enough. There is never enough because the desire is turned on and doesn’t turn off at some number. It’s a fallacy to think it turns off at some number.": {"path":null,"embeddings":{"TaylorAI/bge-micro-v2":{"vec":[0.022672,0.03539282,-0.02384994,-0.04438787,0.00367004,-0.01243583,0.04037487,-0.00302544,0.0423995,-0.02839731,0.07434181,-0.03239225,0.02480802,0.03188026,-0.02814563,0.02175736,-0.0251316,-0.01820603,-0.03106231,0.04653193,0.15122345,-0.08863473,0.00953009,-0.08066911,0.08486082,0.01032149,0.05510277,-0.02374654,-0.0572037,-0.12757516,-0.00468803,-0.01281664,0.0087591,0.01643614,0.0032243,0.01856907,-0.03824036,0.06849551,0.00482312,0.04819871,-0.05089391,0.04723358,-0.04893748,-0.05829621,0.00324441,-0.04910282,-0.03154016,-0.00542095,0.06255723,0.03369157,-0.02628302,-0.00559456,-0.0553732,0.02674988,0.02760903,-0.00649076,0.0319881,0.08388428,-0.00194122,0.00407287,0.01320647,0.03623892,-0.16337723,0.01389059,0.0294038,0.03251122,-0.02023323,0.08655051,-0.03313451,0.01764886,0.04751293,-0.00895271,0.02621286,0.02385995,-0.04353703,-0.04007728,0.0164929,0.00825643,-0.02149864,-0.01638112,0.06998308,0.00083034,-0.01273421,-0.03737409,-0.04730299,-0.06709909,0.03517868,-0.04188816,0.0085477,-0.00731445,0.0308469,-0.00263327,0.00658542,-0.02673761,0.00651978,-0.00725791,-0.00958355,-0.00734007,-0.07730844,0.08795895,-0.01059239,0.06284862,0.0170217,-0.06426699,0.09270067,-0.02536875,0.02008204,-0.01740737,-0.00664597,-0.00524273,-0.04838537,0.02287518,0.02383962,-0.06940349,-0.00816889,-0.03987642,-0.01002071,0.0262732,-0.02015274,-0.0335859,-0.0676772,0.02391629,0.05728745,0.03331404,-0.00548716,-0.15141338,0.01981855,0.09215403,0.04455407,0.02351605,0.03653055,-0.05700776,-0.05862914,0.02503813,0.02602813,-0.01193303,-0.04123192,0.04858036,0.04534335,-0.01224261,-0.03163865,-0.11938565,-0.06442302,-0.03346158,-0.0077724,-0.01701978,0.07335614,-0.00555262,0.04044643,0.03112384,-0.01531638,0.03107247,-0.06127181,-0.04232064,0.02548155,-0.05138429,0.00390089,0.04790806,-0.12205382,0.01687344,0.04646467,0.0217435,-0.06231709,0.00246434,0.03366743,0.0219796,-0.02290308,0.02729627,0.02346907,-0.04086437,0.01151284,-0.03765345,-0.06996402,-0.00080609,0.05096383,-0.01480926,-0.00536905,-0.01261302,-0.04244591,0.02635686,0.0200433,0.00121535,-0.04705105,0.04997492,0.03790041,-0.02552794,-0.07436259,-0.06040769,0.04527697,-0.02061081,-0.0556921,0.01735103,-0.09543596,0.04668798,-0.0435134,-0.02474472,0.00318179,0.00154154,-0.06343258,0.03906786,-0.0577171,-0.00966078,0.03738187,0.02708879,0.05899519,0.09725627,0.01542033,-0.03509219,0.0157232,-0.00066881,0.01371106,-0.0000738,-0.00752567,0.05114352,-0.04249617,-0.03382448,0.09040189,0.07268026,0.02445011,-0.05234927,0.04101731,-0.02735727,-0.04903383,-0.18745215,-0.01904119,-0.01878465,-0.01449616,0.11958111,-0.00323226,0.00434365,-0.0126323,-0.00769287,0.05677173,-0.00197206,-0.0542529,-0.0114607,-0.01737334,-0.01026726,0.04700466,-0.06311233,-0.00369429,-0.03557318,0.03185172,-0.08527595,0.05864592,0.02046624,-0.10288817,0.0233891,0.02341985,0.1635382,0.06621329,0.01950989,0.06988097,0.03781745,0.01895033,-0.02445257,-0.16149451,0.04921982,-0.00275504,0.04095287,-0.05090284,-0.0858086,-0.00731736,-0.03279002,0.03510243,0.01450523,-0.01096524,-0.080552,0.02312675,-0.01682934,0.01213856,0.02079912,0.09997102,-0.02120047,0.02032032,-0.01202916,0.08040034,0.03665344,-0.0231984,-0.08745126,-0.02965834,-0.00737515,0.05147958,0.04832059,0.03817415,0.01167046,-0.05232014,0.04527424,0.00598902,0.00245782,-0.05430982,0.02753757,0.03371534,0.01007319,0.10497545,0.00094268,-0.08907211,-0.02766014,-0.00518639,-0.00149902,-0.01661468,-0.04907,-0.0197492,0.01641237,-0.03382666,0.04014579,0.00974769,-0.03367009,-0.0278393,-0.01774646,-0.04963285,0.07823216,-0.03597603,-0.07849826,-0.03480192,-0.04076244,-0.02096049,-0.01647093,0.05838212,-0.20490751,-0.00241285,0.03402716,0.04737076,0.02557867,0.00818516,0.04481347,0.01691097,-0.1388756,0.07016791,0.05163637,0.06568912,0.01467643,-0.04186452,0.01926518,-0.05798002,0.0667374,-0.03627416,0.0769519,0.04096336,0.06498259,0.03325544,0.21365641,-0.02037455,-0.00015465,0.00682863,-0.0032135,0.01202841,0.02821459,0.05560399,-0.01543512,0.00358767,0.03261421,-0.02546878,0.05905517,0.07123446,0.00696621,-0.02000641,0.05238927,-0.05655287,-0.0666858,0.09092138,0.05375313,0.0547885,0.17249067,-0.05215062,0.01275559,-0.03145778,0.07517057,-0.01248942,-0.02150345,0.02618858,0.01349,-0.05626726,-0.02685058,0.0003715,-0.10750414,-0.00657294,0.02330234,0.01287037,-0.03083382,0.04727801,-0.04718115,0.0536473,-0.01123851],"last_embed":{"hash":"bcde8dcad25a63bfcc65e17e620bfbea11bb386aa1a42cfbdde1276a7062fac0","tokens":158}}},"text":null,"length":0,"last_read":{"hash":"bcde8dcad25a63bfcc65e17e620bfbea11bb386aa1a42cfbdde1276a7062fac0","at":1742194601754},"key":"excerpts articles/Almanack of Naval Ravikant.md#quotes#Money is not the root of all evil; there’s nothing evil about it.

"smart_blocks:excerpts articles/Almanack of Naval Ravikant.md#quotes#You make money to solve your money and material problems.

"smart_blocks:excerpts articles/Almanack of Naval Ravikant.md#quotes#Just recently, Babak Nivi, my co-founder, and I were talking on Twitter about how one gets lucky, and there are really four kinds of luck we were talking about. The first kind of luck is blind luck where one just gets lucky because something completely out of their control happened. This includes fortune, fate, etc. Then, there’s luck through persistence, hard work, hustle, and motion. This is when you’re running around creating opportunities. You’re generating a lot of energy, you’re doing a lot to stir things up. It’s almost like mixing a petri dish or mixing a bunch of reagents and seeing what combines. You’re just generating enough force, hustle, and energy for luck to find you. A third way is you become very good at spotting luck. If you are very skilled in a field, you will notice when a lucky break happens in your field, and other people who aren’t attuned to it won’t notice. So, you become sensitive to luck. The last kind of luck is the weirdest, hardest kind, where you build a unique character, a unique brand, a unique mindset, which causes luck to find you.":

articles/Almanack of Naval Ravikant.md#quotes#Just recently, Babak Nivi, my co-founder, and I were talking on Twitter about how one gets lucky, and there are really four kinds of luck we were talking about. The first kind of luck is blind luck where one just gets lucky because something completely out of their control happened. This includes fortune, fate, etc. Then, there’s luck through persistence, hard work, hustle, and motion. This is when you’re running around creating opportunities. You’re generating a lot of energy, you’re doing a lot to stir things up. It’s almost like mixing a petri dish or mixing a bunch of reagents and seeing what combines. You’re just generating enough force, hustle, and energy for luck to find you. A third way is you become very good at spotting luck. If you are very skilled in a field, you will notice when a lucky break happens in your field, and other people who aren’t attuned to it won’t notice. So, you become sensitive to luck. The last kind of luck is the weirdest, hardest kind, where you build a unique character, a unique brand, a unique mindset, which causes luck to find you.","lines":[76,76],"size":1086,"outlinks":[],"class_name":"SmartBlock"},

"smart_blocks:excerpts articles/Almanack of Naval Ravikant.md#quotes#Can practicing meditation help you accept reality? Yeah. But it’s amazing how little it helps. [laughs] You can be a long-time meditator, but if someone says the wrong thing in the wrong way, you go back to your ego-driven self.

"smart_blocks:excerpts articles/Almanack of Naval Ravikant.md#quotes#There is no legacy. There’s nothing to leave. We’re all going to be gone. Our children will be gone. Our works will be dust.

"smart_blocks:excerpts articles/Almanack of Naval Ravikant.md#quotes#There is no meaning to life. There is no purpose to life. Osho said, “It’s like writing on water or building houses of sand.” The reality is you’ve been dead for the history of the Universe, 10 billion years or more. You will be dead for the next 70 billion years or so, until the heat death of the Universe. Anything you do will fade.

## Intelligence
- The ability to act (decide) effectively when there is no script ("knowing what to do when we do not know what to do")
- Pursuing our purposes also in new situations
- Intelligence is not exclusive to human beings

### INTELLIGENT MACHINES
- Recommend a new video to a new user so as to increase overall clicks / time spent (neither video nor user existed when the agent was created)
- Autonomous, adaptive, purposeful behaviour (= intelligent behaviour)

### PROGRESS TOWARDS A GOAL (Telos)
Effect: ever more complete and accurate annotation of a collection of images.
- steady /inevitable progress - goal directed behaviour - ("game with a purpose")
The participants do not need to be aware of the overall goal,
nor can they do anything about it.

### SOCIAL MACHINE
A mechanism where certain functions are performed by human participants, communicating only through the mechanism, and executing specified / constrained tasks.

Eg: a bureaucracy whose participants interact through forms, and / or a filing system.
Eg: a moving assembly line where the participants execute a specified task
Tim Berners-Lee: the WWW allows us to create social machines with a digital infrastructure

### TELEOLOGICAL SOCIAL MACHINES
The ESP game is an example of a social machine that has a purpose.
• The participants execute highly structured tasks
	• (they could be replaced by a software)
• The digital infrastructure
	• Choses the tasks for each
	• Collects the output / results
	• Calculates and delivers the rewards
• The machine has a direction of progress independent of the participants
• Stafford Beer: *"The purpose of a system is what it does"*

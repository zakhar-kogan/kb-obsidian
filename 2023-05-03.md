# Social Machines a new form of intelligence
[Minerva Lecture - Social Machines a new form of intelligence on Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/823344161)

## Intelligence
- The ability to act (decide) effectively when there is no script ("knowing what to do when we do not know what to do")
- Pursuing our purposes also in new situations
- Intelligence is not exclusive to human beings

### INTELLIGENT MACHINES
- Recommend a new video to a new user so as to increase overall clicks / time spent (neither video nor user existed when the agent was created)
- Autonomous, adaptive, purposeful behaviour (= intelligent behaviour)

### PROGRESS TOWARDS A GOAL (Telos)
Effect: ever more complete and accurate annotation of a collection of images.
- steady /inevitable progress - goal-directed behaviour - ("game with a purpose")
The participants do not need to be aware of the overall goal,
nor can they do anything about it.

### SOCIAL MACHINE
A mechanism where certain functions are performed by human participants, communicating only through the mechanism, and executing specified / constrained tasks.

Eg: a bureaucracy whose participants interact through forms, and / or a filing system.
Eg: a moving assembly line where the participants execute a specified task
Tim Berners-Lee: the WWW allows us to create social machines with a digital infrastructure

### TELEOLOGICAL SOCIAL MACHINES
The ESP game is an example of a social machine that has a purpose.
- The participants execute highly structured tasks (they could be replaced by a software)
- The digital infrastructure
	- Chooses the tasks for each
	- Collects the output / results
	- Calculates and delivers the rewards
- The machine has a direction of progress independent of the participants
- Stafford Beer: *"The purpose of a system is what it does"*

The ESP game is an example of a social machine that has a purpose.

### RECOMMENDATION AGENTS AND SOCIAL MACHINES
Behaviour of the agent (macro): Given past user's behaviour
(or behavioural signals) select a shortlist of recommendations from the catalogue
The intelligence of the agent: Learn and decide to increase overall clicks/time spent

### INTELLIGENT SOCIAL MACHINES

- Recommendation agents:
	- Pursue a goal (: increase overall clicks / time spent) autonomously and adapting to a mutable environment (: users and contents)
	-  Exploit statistical relations found in data (: their experience)
	- Experiment with users to acquire missing information
- The algorithm alone is not sufficient their intelligent behaviour emerges from the interaction of billions of users with billions of content items, carefully mediated by the algorithm

**Collaborative:** YouTube, Facebook
**Micro**: user wants information / entertainment
**Macro**: mechanism wants attention / time / control
**Competitive:** eBay
**Micro**: customer / bidder wants to spend the least
**Macro**: mechanism, auctioneer wants the highest price
**Collaborative** (?): tripadvisor, ...
**Micro**: customer wants to reward service...
**Macro**: mechanism wants to find best services i (\*) in its list
(\*) note: this does influence their behaviour - 2nd order effect

### EMERGENT AND COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE
- A type of (collective and emergent) intelligence similar to that of an ant colony
- The colony acts as an intelligent entity
	* Makes decisions on the basis of information that its individuals cannot have (eg for relocation, but also foraging)
	* Tracing the boundaries of the system: we consider all participants (and the infrastructure that connects them) as part of a single system
- Social intelligence and Gaia's hypothesis (an ecological intelligence?)

### Controlling the system
How easy is it to steer the behaviour of such a system?
* Micro-Macro problem
* Incentive alignment problem
* Emergent phenomena
* The Meaningful Social Interactions story

### A MISSING SCIENCE
(design and control of social machines)
How can we design and/or control social machines?
- What does the machine want? (stable attractors)
- Can we guide the invisible hand ?
- Mechanism design (inverse game theory)
- Complex systems theory
- Emergent behaviour and drift?
- Micro / macro problem
- Incentive alignment?
- What can / cannot a social machine learn?
= Economics, statistical physics, computer science ...

### A MISSING SCIENCE
(management and inspection of social machines)
- STS - Science-Technology-Society:
- Al emerges from a socio-technical system
- Al influences society as it interacts with it
Legal theory: - how to regulate / inspect a social machine?
- Who is responsible? (producer, operator, user, agent?)
- Eg: when something happens like in the case of Molly ...
= Legal studies, politics, sociology, socio-technical systems theory

> A warning from Norbert Wiener, 1950
Our machines may do what we ask them to,
literally.
If we ask them to increase clicks or time spent,
they will do just that.
Social norms, secondary effects, unintended
consequences, nuance ..

==Much like the invisible hand, and the monkey's paw, Intelligent machines are not hostile, they are indifferent==

Future research will need to...
- Understand the individual and collective effects of Social Machines
- Learn how to steer social machines in "our" intended directions
- Enable legal regulation

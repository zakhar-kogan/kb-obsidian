## Intelligence
- The ability to act (decide) effectively when there is no script ("knowing what to do when we do not know what to do")
- Pursuing our purposes also in new situations
- Intelligence is not exclusive to human beings

### INTELLIGENT MACHINES
- Recommend a new video to a new user so as to increase overall clicks / time spent (neither video nor user existed when the agent was created)
- Autonomous, adaptive, purposeful behaviour (= intelligent behaviour)

### PROGRESS TOWARDS A GOAL (Telos)
Effect: ever more complete and accurate annotation of a collection of images.
- steady /inevitable progress - goal directed behaviour - ("game with a purpose")
The participants do not need to be aware of the overall goal,
nor can they do anything about it.

### SOCIAL MACHINE
A mechanism where certain functions are performed by human participants, communicating only through the mechanism, and executing specified / constrained tasks.

Eg: a bureaucracy whose participants interact through forms, and / or a filing system.
Eg: a moving assembly line where the participants execute a specified task
Tim Berners-Lee: the WWW allows us to create social machines with a digital infrastructure

### TELEOLOGICAL SOCIAL MACHINES
The ESP game is an example of a social machine that has a purpose.
• The participants execute highly structured tasks
	• (they could be replaced by a software)
• The digital infrastructure
	• Choses the tasks for each
	• Collects the output / results
	• Calculates and delivers the rewards
• The machine has a direction of progress independent of the participants
• Stafford Beer: *"The purpose of a system is what it does"*

The ESP game is an example of a social machine that has a purpose.

### RECOMMENDATION AGENTS AND SOCIAL MACHINES
Behaviour of the agent (macro): Given past user's behaviour
(or behavioural signals) select a shortlist of recommendations from the catalogue
The intelligence of the agent: Learn and decide to increase overall clicks/time spent

### INTELLIGENT SOCIAL MACHINES

• Recommendation agents:
	• Pursue a goal (: increase overall clicks / time spent) autonomously and adapting to a mutable environment (: users and contents)
	•  Exploit statistical relations found in data (: their experience)
	• Experiment with users to acquire missing information
• The algorithm alone is not sufficient their intelligent behaviour emerges from the interaction of billions of users with billions of content items, carefully mediated by the algorithm

**Collaborative:** YouTube, Facebook
**Micro**: user wants information / entertainment
**Macro**: mechanism wants attention / time / control
**Competitive:** eBay
**Micro**: customer / bidder wants to spend the least
**Macro**: mechanism, auctioneer wants the highest price
**Collaborative** (?): tripadvisor, ...
**Micro**: customer wants to reward service...
**Macro**: mechanism wants to find best services i (\*) in its list
(\*) note: this does influence their behaviour - 2nd order effect

### EMERGENT AND COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE
• A type of (collective and emergent) intelligence similar to that of an ant colony
• The colony acts as an intelligent entity
	* Makes decisions on the basis of information that its individuals cannot have (eg for relocation, but also foraging)
	* Tracing the boundaries of the system: we consider all participants (and the infrastructure that connects them) as part of a single system
• Social intelligence and Gaia's hypothesis (an ecological intelligence?)

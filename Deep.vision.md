The information processed.
*the stick becomes an edge of a knowledge graph*

## The vision of a vision
Giving the visually impaired access to knowledge will empower them to live life to the 100%, without the clutter
(*some edges and nodes highlighted, important*)

## And we've found out how to do it
*(Same slide + added semantic links, as verbs)*

## A vision
*(Visualization of semantic graph as sound/touch)*
*(blind bat man/bionic eyes on the right)*

## Flow
*Associative links as knowledge + hearing/touch modulation -> 0% disability (goes from 80% to the left)*

## Deep
- a **battle-tested semantic knowledge management software**
- flexible and easy to integrate with any data
- **opportunity to work, learn and live** despite the darkness
(*logo?*)
## Only a shallow understanding required
Bringing unlimited **links**
*visualization of different data sources and actions to take*

## Example cases
Customized to the interessant, required nodes/vertices highlighted:
- Buying from a grocery store
- Passing a proctored exam
- Ordering flowers
- Receiving an e-gov service

## **Tangible** benefits

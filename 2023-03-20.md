## Due Diligence: what to expect and how to prepare
### Caveat emptor: let the buyer beware
According to this principle, the buyers
are responsible for reasonably
examining what they buy. I.e., perform
due diligence.
The seller who conceals information
will be liable for the defects concealed.
Purposes of due diligence:
Find deal-breakers
Adjust valuation
Draft representations and
warranties

### Warranty examples
Intellectual property. The Company owns or possesses or believes it can acquire on commercially
reasonable terms sufficient legal rights to all Company Intellectual Property without any known
conflict with, or infringement of, the rights of others, including prior employees or consultants. The
Company has not received any communications alleging that the Company has violated, or by
conducting its business, would violate any of the patents, trademarks, service marks,
tradenames, copyrights, trade secrets, mask works or other proprietary rights or processes of any
other Person.
Litigation. There is no claim, action, suit, proceeding, arbitration, complaint, charge or
investigation pending or to the Company's knowledge, currently threatened in writing (i) against
the Company or any officer, director, or employee of the Company arising out of their employment
or board relationship with the Company.

### Disclosure letter
Warranties usually apply with
exceptions that are described in
a Disclosure Letter.

A disclosureLetter is drafted against
warranties and is based on what was
disclosed to the investor in the course of due
diligence.

### Who is responsible for reps and warranties?
•
•
the target company itself
the founders (jointly and severally)
sometimes other shareholders
as well.

### Limitation of liability
Usually no liability cap for the title to the
stock, validity of contract, and taxes.
Liability cap equal to the amount
invested for other warranties, such as
intellectual property, material contracts,
litigation, etc.

### Process
DD is usually performed at equity
financing, although some investors
may do a basic DD before buying
a SAFE or a convertible promissory
note.
The bigger is the valuation and
amount of financing, the more
scrupulous is due diligence.

The investor sends you a request for
information and documentation, you
answer it and upload relevant docs to
a virtual data room. A Google Drive
folder will do.
° Keep electronic copies of all
paperwork, including corporate
documentation, contracts and invoices.

### Corporate documentation
Everything related to incorporation:
articles, bylaws, etc.
Corporate resolutions: all resolutions
taken by the stockholders or the board
of directors.
Fundraising history, issue of stock and
convertible instruments.
Stockholders agreements.

• If something is not publicly disclosed
(like a resolution to issue shares), it
doesn't mean you don't need it.
• Make a short description of your
fundraising history.

### Team & employment
Organization chart.
Contracts with each member of a team.
If you have employees, all paperwork
showing compliance with local laws.
Any understandings regarding allocation
of stock options.

• Even if a founder is not getting paid,
you need a contract to assign rights,
protect information, and ensure his
commitment to the company.
• For the work already done, you can
sign CIA (Confidential Information and
Invention Assignment Agreement) or a
Confirmatory Assignment.

### IP and intangible assets
A list or description of what you own,
when was it created/acquired, who
created it.
Assignment of rights to the target
company.
List of third-party IP you use, including
free open source software (libraries). Do
you comply with the license terms?

• Make a list of what intellectual
property and other intangible assets you
own: software, art, trade secrets,
domain names, websites, brands.
° Ideally, you should be able to
demonstrate the chain of contracts
between an author and your company.

### Finance and borrowings
(Only formally covered by law)
Company's bank and fintech accounts.
Indebtedness and borrowings, including
loans provided by the founders.
Tax benefits used.
All tax returns and forms filed.
Confirmation of tax payment. Any
communications with tax authorities.

### Sales and material agreements
Revenue-generating agreements.
Memorandums of understanding,
letters of intent, term sheets.
If you are b2c, show the customer
onboarding process. What agreements
a customer accepts before paying?
Everything you depend or spend a lot of
money on, like infrastructure or rent.

• Prepare a chart showing your
financial flows and a brief description of
how you work.

### Regulation and licensing
Any specific regulation you have to
comply with. For example, if you are a
medtech startup, do you need to be
certified or licensed under state or
federal laws?
Personally identifiable information:
what data do you process,
what data subjects are involved, and
what measures do you implement.

• What to avoid: sensitive categories
of data, like health or political beliefs;
minors.
Be aware of EU regulation.

### Litigation and threatened action
Litigation and threatened action
Insurance policies
Incumbrances over the company's
property
Guarantees and security arrangements

• If you are an early stage startup,
you'll probably answer "no" to all of it

## O1 Visa
### Start early
- Begin collecting evidence even before you start the application process
Importance of documenting achievements such as articles, successful
projects scientific publications
Building and maintaining a professional network for potential recommendation
letters
- Early preparation helps ensure a comprehensive and robust application,
showcasing the full scope of your accomplishments

### Select an immigration lawyer
Ensure credibility: Work with a licensed lawyer, preferably one with a proven
track record among your acquaintances (it's okay to ask for their license)
Industry expertise: Make sure the lawyer has experience and success in
working with individuals in your specific industry
Personal compatibility: Ensure you are comfortable working with your lawyer,
as it will be a long journey; consider factors like communication style, working
style (strict vs. relaxed), etc.

### First consultation
Importance of investing in a first consultation, which typically costs $250-$350
- Benefits of a consultation include personalized advice, understanding the
process, and evaluating your lawyer's expertise
- Most lawyers will include the consultation fee in their contract if you choose to
work with them, making it a valuable investment

## Due Diligence: what to expect and how to prepare
### Caveat emptor: let the buyer beware
According to this principle, the buyers are responsible for reasonably examining what they buy. I.e., perform due diligence.
The seller who conceals information will be liable for the defects concealed.
Purposes of due diligence:
* Find deal-breakers
* Adjust valuation
* Draft representations and warranties

### Warranty examples
* Intellectual property. The Company owns or possesses or believes it can acquire on commercially reasonable terms sufficient legal rights to all Company Intellectual Property without any known conflict with, or infringement of, the rights of others, including prior employees or consultants.
* The company has not received any communications alleging that the Company has violated or, by conducting its business, would violate any of the patents, trademarks, service marks, tradenames, copyrights, trade secrets, mask works, or other proprietary rights or processes of any other Person.
* Litigation. There is no claim, action, suit, proceeding, arbitration, complaint, charge or investigation pending or to the Company's knowledge, currently threatened in writing (i) against the Company or any officer, director, or employee of the Company arising out of their employment or board relationship with the Company.

### Disclosure letter
* Warranties usually apply with exceptions that are described in a Disclosure Letter.
* A disclosure Letter is drafted against warranties and is based on what was disclosed to the investor in the course of due diligence.

### Who is responsible for reps and warranties?
* Target company itself
* Founders (jointly and severally)
* Sometimes other shareholders as well

### Limitation of liability
* Usually no liability cap for the title to the stock, validity of the contract, and taxes.
* Liability cap equal to the amount invested for other warranties, such as intellectual property, material contracts, litigation, etc.

### Process
DD is usually performed at equity financing, although some investors may do a basic DD before buying a SAFE or a convertible promissory note.
The bigger the valuation and amount of financing, the more scrupulous is due diligence.

The investor sends you a request for information and documentation, you answer it and upload relevant docs to a virtual data room. A Google Drive folder will do.
Keep electronic copies of all paperwork, including corporate documentation, contracts and invoices.

### Corporate documentation
* Everything related to incorporation: articles, bylaws, etc.
* Corporate resolutions: all resolutions taken by the stockholders or the board of directors
* Fundraising history, issue of stock and convertible instruments
* Stockholders agreements
* If something is not publicly disclosed (like a resolution to issue shares), it doesn't mean you don't need it
* Make a short description of your fundraising history.

### Team & employment
* Organization chart
* Contracts with each member of a team
* If you have employees, all paperwork showing compliance with local laws.
* Any understandings regarding the allocation of stock options.

* Even if a founder is not getting paid, you need a contract to assign rights, protect information, and ensure his commitment to the company.
* For the work already done, you can sign CIA (Confidential Information and Invention Assignment Agreement) or a Confirmatory Assignment.

### IP and intangible assets
* A list or description of what you own, when was it created/acquired, and who created it.
* Assignment of rights to the target company.
* List of third-party IPs you use, including free open-source software (libraries). Do you comply with the license terms?
* Make a list of what intellectual property and other intangible assets you own: software, art, trade secrets, domain names, websites, brands.
* Ideally, you should be able to demonstrate the chain of contracts between an author and your company.

### Finance and borrowings
(Only formally covered by law)
* Company's bank and fintech accounts
* Indebtedness and borrowings, including loans provided by the founders
* Tax benefits used
* All tax returns and forms filed
* Confirmation of tax payment
* Any communications with tax authorities

### Sales and material agreements
* Revenue-generating agreements
* Memorandums of understanding, letters of intent, term sheets.
* If you are b2c, show the customer onboarding process. What agreements does a customer accept before paying?
* Everything you depend on or spend a lot of money on, like infrastructure or rent.
* Prepare a chart showing your financial flows and a brief description of how you work.

### Regulation and licensing
Any specific regulation you have to comply with. For example, if you are a medtech startup, do you need to be certified or licensed under state or federal laws?
* Personally identifiable information
	* what data do you process,
	* what data subjects are involved, and
	* what measures do you implement?

* What to avoid: sensitive categories of data, like health or political beliefs; minors.
* Be aware of EU regulations.

### Litigation and threatened action
* Litigation and threatened action
* Insurance policies
* Incumbrances over the company's property
* Guarantees and security arrangements

* If you are an early-stage startup,
you'll probably answer "no" to all of it

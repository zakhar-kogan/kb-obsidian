_"Centralization describes the concentration of power, decision making and control over network resources in the hands of a few actors. In a web3 context, centralized systems are able to internally process transactions very quickly and cheaply, since there is no need to coordinate. However, centralized systems need to be trusted by users and other stakeholders. Negligence and misconduct can lead to collateral damage and is often described as the “central point of failure”. As only few parties need to be involved, collusion and monopolization of power happen more easily. Centralization can also have negative effects on innovation, as decisions can be mandated, ideas can be censored, and access can be restricted._ 

_Centralization can increase the ability to react on changing environments and to enact changes quickly. Additionally it might be needed to identify actors that are in control and take responsibility for decisions and results, often due to regulatory systems."_

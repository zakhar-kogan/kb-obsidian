## Decentralization
![](https://i.imgur.com/dEap9Qf.png)
_"Centralization describes the concentration of power, decision making and control over network resources in the hands of a few actors. In a web3 context, centralized systems are able to internally process transactions very quickly and cheaply, since there is no need to coordinate. However, centralized systems need to be trusted by users and other stakeholders. Negligence and misconduct can lead to collateral damage and is often described as the “central point of failure”. As only few parties need to be involved, collusion and monopolization of power happen more easily. Centralization can also have negative effects on innovation, as decisions can be mandated, ideas can be censored, and access can be restricted._ 

_Centralization can increase the ability to react on changing environments and to enact changes quickly. Additionally it might be needed to identify actors that are in control and take responsibility for decisions and results, often due to regulatory systems."_

_"Decentralization can increase the resilience of the system and protect against negligence and misconduct. As there is no “central point of failure”, collusion and attacks on the system become much more costly. In a web3 context, decentralized systems can provide much more open platforms for anyone to innovate on, while providing possibilities for standardization and interoperability. Additionally, the censorship resistance and immutability properties of many of these systems can reduce many costs that cover uncertainties and risk of counterparties._

_However, decentralized systems need good ways to coordinate on any change. Unforeseen events might need quick resolution, which can take longer when coordination and agreements are needed. Decentralized systems also pose challenges to regulatory systems, which are often not yet willing or able to accomodate systems without anyone responsible. The need for coordination and agreement also poses challenges for scalability and transaction costs in these systems."_

The decentralization of Web3 ecosystems again, is not binary and needs to be evaluated along many metrics. Decentralization always occurs on some scale and can change drastically over time.

Let's look from another angle - and this quote from our governance research colleague Burrrata at BlockScience talking about the purpose of decentralization. 

He says, _“In the context of token system security, the main purpose of ‘decentralization’ is to prevent any party (internal or external) from imposing its will on the system and its stakeholders._ 

_If a system is ‘decentralized’ you can trust the system even if you don’t trust the participants.”_   

He also stresses decentralization as "reducing the points of failure."

### Paradox of decentralization

## Progressive decentralization

Here, we'll draw again on operational research and management cybernetics pioneer Stafford Beer to point to a core lesson here:  
  
He says, "The purpose of a system is what it does. There is after all no point in claiming that a purpose of a system is to do what it constantly fails to do."

**"Progressive Decentralization" is the idea that you start a platform, organization or project and after some time, "decentralize" various aspects** i.e. decision-making over certain aspects or operations - usually by distributing governance tokens to various stakeholder groups.  
  
**The purpose can range from avoiding legal regulation, to a genuine desire for horizontal scaling  and harnessing collective intelligence towards an aim (not mutually exclusive).**

As we learned, **centralization and decentralization often exist simultaneously**, confirming Beer's assertion. W**e must look at what a system *actually does rather than projected narratives** and intent. We can do so by taking an analytical, scientific approach and looking at multiple sources of information and data. T**he goal or purpose of a system may not necessarily "require political decentralization"** - especially in the realm of progressive decentralization, where often, founding teams and investors of financial products maintain a high concentration of tokens and governance power.

We also saw that **i****t's not easy to "Just DAO it"** - who will you hand tasks to? Do they have the skills? Are the incentives and infrastructure in place? Have the functions and roles been mapped?  
  
With this understanding, there may be another way to read the "Just DAO it" meme - that it is not meant to be taken literally but that it is actually ironic. Like most "art," it is often a reflection of who is viewing it.  
  
The best description of Progressive Decentralization and the infant Web3 space may be, as one colleague, [Ome Gak](https://github.com/OmeGak), said - **"stuck between the tyranny of tyranny and the [Tyranny of Structurelessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tyranny_of_Structurelessness)."**

## Autonomy

"Chapter 5: Effective Freedom and Collective Autonomy" the book "Anarchist Cybernetics: Control and Communication in Radical politics", Stafford Beer's Viable Systems Model and his experience designing crypto-economic systems, to contextualize the interactions between an individual and a collective - primarily in the context of Web3 systems - to illustrate four subsets of autonomy: individual, collective, tactical and strategic.

Hassan and De Filippi identified the common threads in their research, and came up with the following characteristics as representative of DAOs:
- They enable people to coordinate and self-govern online 
- A DAO source code is deployed in a blockchain 
- And a DAO’s smart contract code specifies the rules for interaction among members
- That the organization's rules are self-executing since they are maintained in smart contracts
- They are likely aiming to be independent from central control
- Value transparency, cryptographic security and decentralization

"Decentralized technologies are an experiment in designing, building, and enacting alternative, participatory forms of organizational infrastructure." (Nabben)  
  
DAOs can range from investment vehicles, to social clubs, service providers, non-profits, commons or some combination. "DAOs are as varied as the heterogeneous groups of people that compose them. Depending on the values of a group of people, the motivation for a DAO can be to make money (known as “DeFi degenerates”, which stands for “Decentralized Finance”), to further “regenerative finance” (ReFi) efforts to counteract resource consumption and climate change, or for creative expression such as “Non-Fungible Token” (NFT) artist communities." (Nabben & Zargham 2022)

"Should a DAO operate 'without human intervention'" is actually a question that indicates a lack of understanding in that **there is always a design layer, someone is making the rules that are encoded, and although some functions can be automated - there is always subjectivity and a human at the other end of the code.**

## Algorithms as policy
"Many of the world’s most influential systems — from social media to justice, transportation systems to healthcare — are guided by machine learning algorithms programmed in black boxes with little or no oversight (Fry, H. [Hello World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43726517-hello-world)). A lack of access, transparency and accountability has led to our deepening “algorithmic dependence”, creating fractured information streams and trust in society (Zargham, M. & Nabben K., [Algorithms as Policy](https://medium.com/block-science/algorithms-as-policy-44e289d34a65)). In an era so profoundly affected by algorithmic policy design, it is more important than ever to promote education around these topics ... and illuminate these “black boxes.” (Jessica Zartler, [Announcing cadCAD 1.0: Foundations for a New Era of Open Modeling](https://medium.com/block-science/announcing-cadcad-1-0-foundations-for-a-new-era-of-open-modeling-ea636b64fda7))

![](https://i.imgur.com/PKgYXRp.png)
according to Zargham the concept of algorithms as policy originated in Control Theory literature. The term was used in describing "decision-making algorithms that respond to observed phenomena (social), synthesize and interpreting data to return actions, driving outcomes based on a predicated intended outcome" - in other words - an algorithm that was designed to optimize for a subjective goal.

![](https://i.imgur.com/uT8Oef8.png)
the acknowledgment of subjectivity is important. The action of choosing the metrics and goals of an algorithm - is where governance takes place, as the policy is enacted at that point and dictates how humans interact with each other.

According to Zargham and Nabben in [Aligning 'Decentralized Autonomous Organization' to Precedents in Cybernetics](https://medium.com/block-science/aligning-the-concept-of-decentralized-autonomous-organization-to-precedents-in-cybernetics-51344d1c1411), "_governance through code enshrines subjective assumptions and goals into a system. Asserting as objective, the assumptions which form the basis for algorithms has been called 'ground truthing'._

_When these assumptions and goals are treated as objective or optimal then community members lose the opportunity to steer."_

So what algorithms / algorithmic policy are being employed in token-based systems? Here are a few examples:
-   [Consensus protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)) underpinning blockchains
-   Parameterizing token models, token issuance policies  
    i.e., [1Hive](https://forum.1hive.org/t/dynamic-honey-supply-policy-proposal/2224), [Token Engineering Commons](https://forum.tecommons.org/t/hatch-parameters-general-discussion-thread/61), [RAI](https://medium.com/reflexer-labs/summoning-the-money-god-2a3f3564a5f2)
-   “Rewards"”" Systems (Resource/compensation allocation) i.e., [Source Cred](https://sourcecred.io/), [Coordinape](https://coordinape.com/), [Praise](https://github.com/commons-stack/praise)
    -   Highly subject to [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) (To go deeper on this topic, check out this [Measurement Systems & Contributor Rewards](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l74c0FIuKY0&list=PLhuBigpl7lqvMt8d7h4sbCmra9KbFmAdg&index=19) panel from [Funding the Commons](https://fundingthecommons.io/) 2022 & check out the further research section)
-   The governance & enforcement of Sybil detection algorithms i.e., [Gitcoin](https://medium.com/block-science/operationalizing-the-gitcoindao-anti-sybil-process-7f2595544f44)

This excerpt from [Is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization a Panopticon?](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/t/research-summary-and-ama-with-kelsie-nabben-rmit-university-can-algorithmic-governance-turn-a-dao-into-a-panopticon/960)(Nabben, 2021) summarizes the biggest challenges of algorithms as policy in Web3:

_"Part of living with our new algorithmic governors is acknowledging they are there. As it stands, creators and participants often passively engage with algorithms in DAOs without acknowledging where and how they operate. Transparency in terms of access to the raw code of an algorithm does not mean legibility, that people can understand how it works and effectively govern it as it governs them.  
  
Yet, transparency as to where algorithms are operating may be a first step in being able to critically analyze, question critically, and (heaven forbid)change the code towards more desirable settings for a long-term " win-win" game where people and algorithms adjust as needed, to continue to participate in the community towards a shared purpose.  
  
Participants in these institutions struggle with the dilemma of '‘' can we question code?'’' in what are meant to be immutable, post-human infrastructures. Some DAO communities are fostering a culture of consciously questioning the algorithms they want to govern them and critically reflecting on the culture and values embedded in automated systems. This allows them to adapt to different circumstances, such as when Sybil attackers develop new tactics and collectively change the rules.  
  
Yet, cultivating and maintaining a culture of sensitivity to the explicit and implicit governance rules encoded into algorithms may be challenging for many DAOs as they scale."

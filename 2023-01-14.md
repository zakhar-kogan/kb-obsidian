## Decentralization

_"Centralization describes the concentration of power, decision making and control over network resources in the hands of a few actors. In a web3 context, centralized systems are able to internally process transactions very quickly and cheaply, since there is no need to coordinate. However, centralized systems need to be trusted by users and other stakeholders. Negligence and misconduct can lead to collateral damage and is often described as the “central point of failure”. As only few parties need to be involved, collusion and monopolization of power happen more easily. Centralization can also have negative effects on innovation, as decisions can be mandated, ideas can be censored, and access can be restricted._ 

_Centralization can increase the ability to react on changing environments and to enact changes quickly. Additionally it might be needed to identify actors that are in control and take responsibility for decisions and results, often due to regulatory systems."_

_"Decentralization can increase the resilience of the system and protect against negligence and misconduct. As there is no “central point of failure”, collusion and attacks on the system become much more costly. In a web3 context, decentralized systems can provide much more open platforms for anyone to innovate on, while providing possibilities for standardization and interoperability. Additionally, the censorship resistance and immutability properties of many of these systems can reduce many costs that cover uncertainties and risk of counterparties._

_However, decentralized systems need good ways to coordinate on any change. Unforeseen events might need quick resolution, which can take longer when coordination and agreements are needed. Decentralized systems also pose challenges to regulatory systems, which are often not yet willing or able to accomodate systems without anyone responsible. The need for coordination and agreement also poses challenges for scalability and transaction costs in these systems."_

The decentralization of Web3 ecosystems again, is not binary and needs to be evaluated along many metrics. Decentralization always occurs on some scale and can change drastically over time.

Let's look from another angle - and this quote from our governance research colleague Burrrata at BlockScience talking about the purpose of decentralization. 

He says, _“In the context of token system security, the main purpose of ‘decentralization’ is to prevent any party (internal or external) from imposing its will on the system and its stakeholders._ 

_If a system is ‘decentralized’ you can trust the system even if you don’t trust the participants.”_   

He also stresses decentralization as "reducing the points of failure."

### Paradox of decentralization

## Progressive decentralization

Here, we'll draw again on operational research and management cybernetics pioneer Stafford Beer to point to a core lesson here:  
  
He says, "The purpose of a system is what it does. There is after all no point in claiming that a purpose of a system is to do what it constantly fails to do."

**"Progressive Decentralization" is the idea that you start a platform, organization or project and after some time, "decentralize" various aspects** i.e. decision-making over certain aspects or operations - usually by distributing governance tokens to various stakeholder groups.  
  
**The purpose can range from avoiding legal regulation, to a genuine desire for horizontal scaling  and harnessing collective intelligence towards an aim (not mutually exclusive).**

As we learned, **centralization and decentralization often exist simultaneously**, confirming Beer's assertion. W**e must look at what a system *actually does rather than projected narratives** and intent. We can do so by taking an analytical, scientific approach and looking at multiple sources of information and data. T**he goal or purpose of a system may not necessarily "require political decentralization"** - especially in the realm of progressive decentralization, where often, founding teams and investors of financial products maintain a high concentration of tokens and governance power.

We also saw that **i****t's not easy to "Just DAO it"** - who will you hand tasks to? Do they have the skills? Are the incentives and infrastructure in place? Have the functions and roles been mapped?  
  
With this understanding, there may be another way to read the "Just DAO it" meme - that it is not meant to be taken literally but that it is actually ironic. Like most "art," it is often a reflection of who is viewing it.  
  
The best description of Progressive Decentralization and the infant Web3 space may be, as one colleague, [Ome Gak](https://github.com/OmeGak), said - **"stuck between the tyranny of tyranny and the [Tyranny of Structurelessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tyranny_of_Structurelessness)."**

## Autonomy

"Chapter 5: Effective Freedom and Collective Autonomy" the book "Anarchist Cybernetics: Control and Communication in Radical politics", Stafford Beer's Viable Systems Model and his experience designing crypto-economic systems, to contextualize the interactions between an individual and a collective - primarily in the context of Web3 systems - to illustrate four subsets of autonomy: individual, collective, tactical and strategic.

# ASSIGNMENT 1 (for Lecture 1)
1. Find two unambiguous (but natural sounding) sentences equivalent to the sentence *The man saw the woman with a telescope*, the first where the man has the telescope, the second where the woman has the telescope.
	1. The man with a telescope saw a woman
	2. The woman with a telescope was seen by a man
2. For each of the three ambiguous newspaper headlines I stated in the lecture, rewrite it in a way that avoids the amusing second meaning, while retaining the brevity of a typical headline:
	1. Sisters reunited after ten years in checkout line at Safeway. -> Reunited in a line: sisters met in a checkout line and reunite after ten years
	2. Large hole appears in High Street. City authorities are looking into it. -> City authorities are investigating the large hole appearing in High Street
	3. Mayor says bus passengers should be belted. -> Bus passengers should wear belts, says the mayor
3. The following notice was posted on the wall of a hospital emergency room: *No head injury is too trivial to ignore.* Reformulate to avoid the unintended second reading. (The context for this sentence is so strong that many people have difficulty seeing there is an alternative meaning.)
	1. Don't ignore even seemingly trivial head injuries
4. You often see the following notice posted in elevators: *In case of fire, do not use elevator.* This one always amuses me. Comment on the two meanings and reformulate to avoid the unintended second reading. (Again, given the context for this notice, the ambiguity is not problematic.)
	1. Do not use the elevator in case of fire in the building.
5. *This page intentionally left blank.* Does the sentence make a true statement? What is the purpose of making such a statement? What reformulation of the sentence would avoid any logical problems about truth?
	1. The page is really not blank if there's text on it
	2. Avoiding printer errors
	3. This page contains no meaningful content
6. Find (and provide citations for) three examples of published sentences whose literal meaning is (clearly) not what the writer intended.

1. Show that $¬[∃xA(x)]$ is equivalent to $∀x[¬A(x)]$.
	1. First is "For no x is A(x) true", second is "There exists x for which A(x) is not true". The second one is a negation of "For each x A(x) is true", the first one is a negation of it, also.
2. Prove False: *There is an even prime bigger than 2*
	1. A prime should not be divisible by anything but 1 and itself. An even prime is divisible by 2, so it cannot exist

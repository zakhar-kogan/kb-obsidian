1. Show that $¬[∃xA(x)]$ is equivalent to $∀x[¬A(x)]$.
	1. First is "For no x is A(x) true", second is "There exists x for which A(x) is not true". The second one is a negation of "For each x A(x) is true", the first one is a negation of it, also.
2. Prove False: *There is an even prime bigger than 2*
	1. A prime should not be divisible by anything but 1 and itself. An even prime is divisible by 2, so it cannot exist

	1. (a) All students like pizza. (All people): $(\forall x \in S) \left[ P(x) \right]$
	2. (b) One of my friends does not have a car. (All people): $\exists x (F(x) \rightarrow \neg C(x)$
	3. (c) Some elephants do not like muffins. (All animals): $\exists x(E(x) \to \neg M(x))$
	4. (d) Every triangle is isosceles. (All geometric figures) $\forall x (T(x) \to I(x))$
	5. (e) Some of the students in the class are not here today. (All people): $\exists x (S(x) \to \neg C(x))$
	6. (f) Everyone loves somebody. (All people): $\forall x \exists y (L(x, y))$
	7. (g) Nobody loves everybody. (All people): $\neg \exists x \forall y (L(x, y))$
	8. (h) If a man comes, all the women will leave. (All people): $\exists m \forall w (C(m) \to L(w))$
	9. (i) All people are tall or short. (All people): $\forall p (T(p) \lor S(p))$
	10. (j) All people are tall or all people are short. (All people): $\forall p (S(p)) \lor \forall p (T(p))$
	11. (k) Not all precious stones are beautiful. (All stones): $\exists s (\neg B(s))$
	12. (l) Nobody loves me. (All people): $\neg \exists x (L(x, me))$
	13. (m) At least one American snake is poisonous. (All snakes): $\exists s \in A (P(s))$ -> $ex$
	14. (n) At least one American snake is poisonous. (All animals)

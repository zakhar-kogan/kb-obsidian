# ASSIGNMENT 3 (For Lecture 3)
1) Let D be the statement “The dollar is strong”, Y the statement “The Yuan is strong” and T the statement “New US–China trade agreement signed”. Express the main content of each of the following (fictitious) newspaper headlines in logical notation.![](https://i.imgur.com/ECmT9mf.png)
	1) $T \Rightarrow (D \wedge Y)$
	2) $D \Rightarrow \neg Y$
	3) $\neg D \Rightarrow \neg T$
	4) $T \Rightarrow (D \wedge Y) \to T \Rightarrow \neg (D \wedge Y)$
	5) $T \Rightarrow (\neg D \wedge Y) \to \neg D \wedge Y \wedge T$
	6) $T \Rightarrow (\neg D \wedge Y) \to T \Rightarrow (Y \Rightarrow \neg D) \to (T \wedge Y) \Rightarrow \neg D$
	7) $T \Rightarrow (D \wedge Y) \to T \Rightarrow (D \Leftrightarrow Y)$
	8) $T \Rightarrow (D \wedge \neg Y) \to T \Rightarrow [(D \vee Y) \wedge \neg (D \wedge Y)]$
2) Complete the following truth table![](https://i.imgur.com/kZxb1J8.png)
	1) $\neg \phi = F, F, T, T$
	2) $\phi \Rightarrow \psi = T, F, T, T$
	3) $\neg \phi \vee \psi = T, T, T, T$
3) ![](https://i.imgur.com/S7CuBpe.png)
	1) $\neg \psi = F, T, F, T$
	2) $\phi \Rightarrow \psi = T, F, T, T$
	3) $\phi \nRightarrow \psi = F, T, F, F$
	4) $\phi \wedge \neg \psi = F, T, F, F$
# ASSIGNMENT 4 (For Lecture 4)
1) Build a truth table to prove the claim I made earlier that φ ⇔ ψ is true if φ and ψ are both true or both false, and φ ⇔ ψ is false if exactly one of φ, ψ is true and the other false. (To constitute a proof, your table should have columns that show how the entries for φ ⇔ ψ are derived, one operator at a time.)
6) By a denial of a statement φ we mean any statement equivalent to ¬φ. Give a useful (and hence natural sounding) denial of each of the following statements:
	1) ![](https://i.imgur.com/S7bhUEQ.png)
	2) 34159 has 2 or more divisors
	3) There are yellow roses, or there can be white morph violets
	4) If there are no hamburgers, I'll go get an ice cream -> Oh I don't want neither hamburgers nor a hot dog
	5) Fred won't go, but he might play elsewhere
	6) $x$ is less or equal than 10, but greater than zero
	7) He won't win neither of two games
7) φ ⇔ ψ is equivalent to (¬φ) ⇔ (¬ψ).
	1) φ ⇔ ψ: T, F, F, T
	2) (¬φ) ⇔ (¬ψ): T, F, F, T
	3) Both: T, T, T, T
8) ![](https://i.imgur.com/5bQsj8z.png)
	1) φ ⇔ ψ: T, F, F, T
	2) $\psi \vee \theta$: T, F, F, F
	3) $\phi \Rightarrow (\psi \vee \theta)$: T, F, T, T
12) Write down the contrapositives of the following statements:![](https://i.imgur.com/iY0T2Q4.png)
	1) If two rectangles are not congruent, they don't have the same area
	2) If a triangle ... isn't right-angled, then the Pythagorean theorem doesn't hold
	3) If $2^n-1$ isn't prime, then $n$ isn't prime
	4) If Yuan doesn't rise, Dollar won't fall
14) Write down the converses ($\psi \Rightarrow \phi$) of the four statements in question 12.
	1) If two rectangles have the same area, they are congruent
	2) If the Pythagorean theorem holds, the triangle is right-angled
	3) If $n$ is prime, then $2^n-1$ is prime, too
	4) If the Dollar falls, the Yuan rises
15)

### [[SIR]] model
Susceptible, Infected, Recovered
Percolation theory

### [[Network]]s
**[degree](degree)** = number of [[node]]'s contacts
**Edge** = connection between nodes
**Node**/vertex = node, huh
**Centrality** = how many nodes are central/have many connections
**Community structure** = nodes coming in clusters

Erdos-Reyni = random-distributed network

### Basic [[reproduction]] number (R0)
Expected number of people a person infects during a disease spreading?

### Problems
#### The same R0 doesn't mean the same level of threat
#### The same disease's R0 isn't the same location- or time-wise

R0 = $$Transmission rate * (({k^2}-{k}) / {k})$$ ,
where **k** = average [[degree]]

**Epidemic threshold** 
$$T > (({k^2}-{k}) / {k})$$

### Tracking in epidemic
**Tracking small "friend" clusters (edged nodes with connections)** can help us precede the "big" outbreaks.

### Vaccination
People to vaccinate:
$$1- 1/R_0$$

Defi option vaults are quickly becoming a popular way for cryptocurrency investors to take advantage of market volatility while minimizing risk. Neuron tries to be at the forefront of employing new ones, with the next offering likely being a call spread.

## Who's calling, who's spreading?

A [call spread strategy](https://www.optionsbro.com/call-debit-spread-option-strategy-example/) involves:
- **purchasing a call option** at a **lower** strike price while simultaneously 
- **selling a call option** at a **higher** strike price. 

## Advantages
### Capped risk

*No pun intended*
Profit from an expected increase in the price of an asset with capped risk. Self-explanatory as, say, a covered call has risk capped at virtually 100% - sexy but not too much.

### Stablecoin collateral
One of the major benefits of using call spread Neuron pools is that one can keep their collateral in stablecoins. 
This means two implicit cheatcodes are activated:
- Bear market is not that dangerous as you're in cash
- Strategies such as [Mellow x Gearbox FRAX/USDC](https://app.mellow.finance/products/mainnet-fearless-fraxusdc-gearbox) leveraged optimizer are available, or MIM-3Crv:

## Disadvantages
### Theta decay

Contrary to covered calls and short puts already present at Neuron, a call spread is a theta-negative strategy meaning *it loses value with time*. However that's offset by almost any positive movement in the underlying asset (e.g. ETH), making a call spread *highly suitable for the current bera-but-signs-of-recovery* epoch.

## Conclusion
It is likely that call spread strategies will become an increasingly popular way for users to capitalize on market movements while minimizing risk. And Neuron will be nearby, at the click of a mouse ðŸ§

A [call spread strategy](https://www.optionsbro.com/call-debit-spread-option-strategy-example/) involves:
- **purchasing a call option** at a **lower** strike price while simultaneously 
- **selling a call option** at a **higher** strike price. 

## Advantages
### Capped risk
Profit from an expected increase in the price of an asset with capped risk. Self-explanatory as, say, a covered call has risk capped at virtually 100% - sexy but not too much.

### Stablecoin collateral
One of the major benefits of using call spread Neuron pools is that one can keep their collateral in stablecoins. 
This means two implicit cheatcodes are activated:

So what is branding?

It isn't just your 'brand' in the sense of a name and logo, although these are important, they are just the identifying triggers of the brand.

A brand in its entirety is actually the logical and emotional responses those triggers invoke in a customer.
Unlike dev work, where the execution of the code tells you that you're wrong, many people claim themselves marketing gurus simply by being able to write English.

If we played a word association game, it would start to paint a picture:

"Volvo" - "Safety"
"BMW" - "Luxury Sport"
"Mercedes" - "Well Engineered"

These are the elements that the brand has worked incredibly hard to own in a place we call the consumers "mindspace"

A brand is what your company is. 

Not rationally on paper, but at its essence in how people feel about it.

A company sells a product "I use an IBM PC" a brand is an emotional identity "I *am* an Apple user"

But, a brand cannot be all things.

In fact the first immutable law of branding (Ries) states that the strength of a brand is inversely proportional to its scope.

That is, the more things you try to be, the less effective you are at it.

Now, not only does that focus create a stronger brand association in our mind, but, Porter would also tell you its a fantastic business strategy, as really the amount of effort it takes to be 'great' at anything is 100x the focus it takes to be good at many things.

When we think of the relationship between companies and customers, the goal of a brand is as follows:

1. Own a specific mindspace, so when a customer is ready to make a buying decision on X, they think of us.

2. Build an emotional identity and clout bank with a customer. (The clout cashes in when they forgive our friction points, or advocate for us as a brand, we need to make that easy for them)

The goal of a brand mark is:

1. Be simple, identifiable, and memorable, so that we lower the effort of recall.

2. Be a simple and unique visual that can exist well in both positive and negative space, so we can be quickly recognized in the limited attention time we have.

As I mentioned before all types of branding and marketing are a science. Despite popular belief, they are highly measurable.

If you are a well funded startup, with a clear user LTV, and know your conversion and churn metrics then maybe that's the right fit for you.

But, there are three things that most defi/crypto businesses are at the right stage for, that do work, and where I think most should be spending their focus these days.

The first is authentic engagement.

This is something that 
@SBF_Alameda
 did well for 
@FTX_Official
 as it got its start. Being on Twitter all the time, engaging with customers, and going the extra mile for them.

The second is one that I think 
@SushiSwap
 does amazingly well and that is cultural marketing.

In our industry currently, there are not a ton of users, its hard to hop the chasm and there is plenty of dry powder capital to fund you, so you aren't desperate for revenue -

But, what is scarce, is talent.

Even crazy high wages can't convince the top talent to come work for you, and so you need to create and foster a team culture and external perspective of the team that is exciting and engaging to attract top talent.

It may seem strange to talk about UX so heavily when we were on about branding.

But that's part of the point.

Marketing is how you convey a message to a user.

Both explicitly, and implicitly.

Every touch point you have *IS* marketing as it shapes how a customer feels about you.

These all impact the mindspace the customer has about you.

Do they see you as secure, professional, safe and reliable? They might not if your layout feels unconsidered.

Instead:

1. Decide what one thing you want your brand to represent.

2. Focus on authentically connecting with your earliest users in ways that don't scale, and embody your brand in these interactions.

3. Work on defining and promoting an engaging culture (product vision, team interaction, community environment) to attract top talent.

4. Focus on every overlooked touchpoint of your product to see if it represents you the way you deserve to be seen.

(Bonus points: If you do have to do something promotional, do something unconventional. Publicity stunts, atypical ads, being the first at something. Be noteworthy and contrarian because earned media beats out paid ads, and its way more fun!)

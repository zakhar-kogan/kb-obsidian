1. **Demand**: The amount of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase at different prices. It is represented by the demand curve, which shows the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded.

2. **Supply**: The amount of a good or service that producers are willing and able to supply at different prices. It is represented by the supply curve, which shows the direct relationship between price and quantity supplied.

3.  **Market Equilibrium**: The point at which the quantity demanded of a good or service equals the quantity supplied, resulting in a stable price and quantity. It is represented by the intersection of the demand and supply curves.

## 5 Factors that can change the demand
### Income
Income ⬆️ leads to demand ⬆️, but depends on the good. Demand curve shifts to the right and up.
For inferior goods ("poor" like instant ramen), income ⬆️ leads to demand ⬇️
### Population
### Tastes
Hamburgers or iPhones, for example
### Related goods
### Substitutes

### Complements

### Expectations
Say, batteries before a hurricane.

## Change in quantity demanded vs a change in demand
A change in quantity demanded refers to a change in the amount of a good or service that consumers are willing to buy at a given price, while a change in demand refers to a shift in the entire demand curve, which can be caused by a variety of factors such as changes in consumer preferences, income etc.

4.  **Elasticity**: The responsiveness of quantity demanded or quantity supplied to a change in price. The price elasticity of demand or the price elasticity of supply can measure elasticity.

5.  **Consumer Surplus**: The difference between the maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay for a good or service and the actual price they pay. It is represented by the area above the demand curve and below the market price.

6.  **Producer Surplus**: The difference between the minimum amount a producer is willing to accept for a good or service and the actual price they receive. It is represented by the area above the market price and below the supply curve.

## Shifts in supply
### Innovation
Lowers costs and increases supply
### Increase in unit price
Decreases supply
### Taxes
Increase cost, decrease supply
### Subsidies
Decrease cost and increase supply
### Expectations
Of a higher price: increase cost of supplying now
### Opportunity costs

7.  **Market Failure**: A situation in which the market does not allocate resources efficiently. This can occur due to externalities, public goods, or market power.

8.  **Externalities**: The costs or benefits of a good or service that are not reflected in its market price. Negative externalities result in underproduction, while positive externalities result in overproduction.

9.  **Public Goods**: Goods or services that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Because they cannot be efficiently provided by the market, they are often provided by the government.

10.  **Market Power**: The ability of firms to influence market prices by controlling a significant portion of the market. This can lead to higher prices and reduced economic efficiency.

11.  **Opportunity Cost**: The cost of an action measured in terms of the next best alternative foregone. It is the value of the best foregone alternative.

12.  **Opportunity Set**: The set of all possible options and their costs.

13.  **Production Possibility Frontier**: A graph showing the maximum combinations of two goods that can be produced with a given set of resources and technology.

14.  **Specialization**: The concept of focusing on a specific task or industry to increase efficiency and productivity.

15.  **Comparative Advantage**: The ability of a person or firm to produce a good or service at a lower opportunity cost than another person or firm.

16.  **Trade**: The exchange of goods and services between countries or individuals.

17.  **Absolute Advantage**: The ability of a person or firm to produce a good or service more efficiently than another person or firm.

18.  **Inflation**: The sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power of money – a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within an economy.

19.  **Aggregate Demand**: The total demand for all goods and services in an economy at a given time.

20.  **Aggregate Supply**: The total supply of all goods and services in an economy at a given time.

21.  **Business Cycle**: The fluctuations in economic activity, such as employment and production, over a period of time. The business cycle includes periods of expansion and contraction, also known as booms and recessions.

22.  **Fiscal Policy**: The use of government spending and taxation to influence the economy. This can include changes in government spending, tax rates, or transfer payments.

23.  **Monetary Policy**: The use of interest rates and the money supply to influence the economy. This can include changes in the discount rate, reserve requirements, or open market operations.

24.  **Income Distribution**: The distribution of income among individuals or households in an economy. This can include measures such as the Gini coefficient or the Lorenz curve.

25.  **Utility**: The satisfaction or happiness that a consumer receives from a good or service. Utility can be measured by the marginal utility of a good or service.

26.  **Budget Constraint**: The limit on the consumption choices available to a consumer given their income and the prices of goods and services.

27.  **Indifference Curve**: A graph showing the combinations of two goods that provide the same level of utility to a consumer.

28.  **Substitution Effect**: The change in consumption due to a change in the relative price of two goods.

29.  **Income Effect**: The change in consumption due to a change in real income.

30. **Perfect Competition**: A market structure characterized by a large number of small firms, homogeneous products, and free entry and exit. In this market structure, firms are price takers and have no market power.

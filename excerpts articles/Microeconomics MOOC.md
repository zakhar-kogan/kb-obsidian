1. **Demand**: The amount of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to purchase at different prices. It is represented by the demand curve, which shows the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded.

2. **Supply**: The amount of a good or service that producers are willing and able to supply at different prices. It is represented by the supply curve, which shows the direct relationship between price and quantity supplied.

3.  **Market Equilibrium**: The point at which the quantity demanded of a good or service equals the quantity supplied, resulting in a stable price and quantity. It is represented by the intersection of the demand and supply curves.

## 5 Factors that can change the demand
### Income
Income ⬆️ leads to demand ⬆️, but depends on the good. Demand curve shifts to the right and up.
For inferior goods ("poor" like instant ramen), income ⬆️ leads to demand ⬇️
### Population
### Tastes
Hamburgers or iPhones, for example
### Related goods
### Substitutes

### Expectations
Say, batteries before a hurricane.

## Change in quantity demanded vs a change in demand
A change in quantity demanded refers to a change in the amount of a good or service that consumers are willing to buy at a given price, while a change in demand refers to a shift in the entire demand curve, which can be caused by a variety of factors such as changes in consumer preferences, income etc.

4.  **Elasticity**: The responsiveness of quantity demanded or quantity supplied to a change in price. The price elasticity of demand or the price elasticity of supply can measure elasticity.

## Elasticity of Supply
![](https://i.imgur.com/zu6trPY.png)
Determinants:
1. Change in Per-Unit Costs with Increased Production
	1. If increased production requires much higher costs, then the supply curve will be inelastic
	2. If production can increase with constant costs then the supply curve will be elastic
2. Time Horizon
	1. Immediately following a price increase, producers can expand output only using their current capacity (making supply inelastic)
	2. Over time, however, producers can expand their capacity (making supply elastic)
3. Share of Market for Inputs
	1. Supply is elastic when the industry is a small demander in its input markets because supply can be expanded without causing a big increase in the demand for the industry's inputs
4. Geographic Scope
	1. The narrower the scope of the market of a good, the more elastic its supply
	2. The wider the scope of the market of a good, the less elastic its supply

## Elasticity of Demand

The More Responsive Quantity Demanded is to a Change in Price, the More Elastic is the Demand Curve

### Determinants of the Elasticity of Demand
* Availability of Substitutes (this is the fundamental determinant)
   For goods with many substitutes, switching brands, when prices change, is EASY, so demand is elastic
* Time Horizon
   Immediately following a price increase, consumers may not be
able to alter their consumption patterns (making demand inelastic)
* Category of the product (specific or broad)
   The broader the classification, the less likely consumers will be to find a substitute (making demand inelastic)
* Necessities vs. Luxuries
   - For necessities, consumers do not change quantity demanded much when the price changes (making demand inelastic)
   - For luxuries, consumers will alter their behavior when the price rises (making demand elastic)
* Purchase Size
   - Consumers are less concerned about price changes when the good feels cheap (making demand inelastic)
	- Consumers become much more concerned about price changes when the good feels expensive (making demand elastic)

5.  **Consumer Surplus**: The difference between the maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay for a good or service and the actual price they pay. It is represented by the area above the demand curve and below the market price.

6.  **Producer Surplus**: The difference between the minimum amount a producer is willing to accept for a good or service and the actual price they receive. It is represented by the area above the market price and below the supply curve.

## Shifts in supply
### Innovation
Lowers costs and increases supply
### Increase in unit price
Decreases supply
### Taxes
Increase cost, decrease supply
### Subsidies
Decrease cost and increase supply
### Expectations
Of a higher price: increase cost of supplying now
### Entry or exit of producers
### Opportunity costs

* How does the price of oil affect the price of
candy bars?
* Higher oil prices -> ethanol ⬆️ -› more sugar cane for ethanol less for sugar -› price of sugar ⬆️ -> cost of producing candy bars ⬆️

## Great economic problem
- Great Economic Problem - how to arrange our limited resource to satisfy as many of our wants as possible
- Resources are not equally valuable in all uses
Solving: 
- Central planning: a single official or bureaucracy is responsible for allocating limited resources
	- Too much information to process
	- Too few incentives

7.  **Market Failure**: A situation in which the market does not allocate resources efficiently. This can occur due to externalities, public goods, or market power.

8.  **Externalities**: The costs or benefits of a good or service that are not reflected in its market price. Negative externalities result in underproduction, while positive externalities result in overproduction.

9.  **Public Goods**: Goods or services that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous. Because they cannot be efficiently provided by the market, they are often provided by the government.

10.  **Market Power**: The ability of firms to influence market prices by controlling a significant portion of the market. This can lead to higher prices and reduced economic efficiency.

11.  **Opportunity Cost**: The cost of an action measured in terms of the next best alternative foregone. It is the value of the best foregone alternative.

12.  **Opportunity Set**: The set of all possible options and their costs.

13.  **Production Possibility Frontier**: A graph showing the maximum combinations of two goods that can be produced with a given set of resources and technology.

14.  **Specialization**: The concept of focusing on a specific task or industry to increase efficiency and productivity.

15.  **Comparative Advantage**: The ability of a person or firm to produce a good or service at a lower opportunity cost than another person or firm.

16. **Trade**: The exchange of goods and services between countries or individuals.
### Trade
* Trade makes people better off when preferences differ
* Trade increases productivity through specialization and the division of knowledge
* Trade increases productivity through specialization according to comparative advantage
### Comparative advantage
![](https://i.imgur.com/OFEVQKg.png)
In two country/person examples everyone is better off. In larger examples, trade increases aggregate wealth but some individuals can be made worse off.

17.  **Absolute Advantage**: The ability of a person or firm to produce a good or service more efficiently than another person or firm.

18.  **Inflation**: The sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power of money – a loss of real value in the medium of exchange and unit of account within an economy.

19.  **Aggregate Demand**: The total demand for all goods and services in an economy at a given time.

20.  **Aggregate Supply**: The total supply of all goods and services in an economy at a given time.

21.  **Business Cycle**: The fluctuations in economic activity, such as employment and production, over a period of time. The business cycle includes periods of expansion and contraction, also known as booms and recessions.

22.  **Fiscal Policy**: The use of government spending and taxation to influence the economy. This can include changes in government spending, tax rates, or transfer payments.

23.  **Monetary Policy**: The use of interest rates and the money supply to influence the economy. This can include changes in the discount rate, reserve requirements, or open market operations.

24.  **Income Distribution**: The distribution of income among individuals or households in an economy. This can include measures such as the Gini coefficient or the Lorenz curve.

25.  **Utility**: The satisfaction or happiness that a consumer receives from a good or service. Utility can be measured by the marginal utility of a good or service.

26.  **Budget Constraint**: The limit on the consumption choices available to a consumer given their income and the prices of goods and services.

27.  **Indifference Curve**: A graph showing the combinations of two goods that provide the same level of utility to a consumer.

28.  **Substitution Effect**: The change in consumption due to a change in the relative price of two goods.

29.  **Income Effect**: The change in consumption due to a change in real income.

30. **Perfect Competition**: A market structure characterized by a large number of small firms, homogeneous products, and free entry and exit. In this market structure, firms are price takers and have no market power.

## Taxes
![](https://i.imgur.com/BNTVpsF.png)

Since it **doesn't matter whether buyers or sellers are taxed**, we can graph the tax as a simple "wedge":
![](https://i.imgur.com/0amonL4.png)

* The more elastic side of the market will pay a smaller share of a tax (smaller burden)
* The less elastic (more inelastic) side of the market will pay a greater share of a tax (greater burden)
* Elastic demand means that demanders have good substitutes for the taxed good and so can escape the tax
* Elastic supply means that the resources used to produce the taxed good can easily be moved to other industries so they can escape the tax
* Someone, however, must pay the tax so the relative elasticities determine the burden

### Tax revenue and deadweight loss
![](https://i.imgur.com/cXmJKb9.png)

We want to **tax inelastic demand goods**:
![](https://i.imgur.com/i1Xxxyf.png)
**If the tax is inelastic, we won't deter a lot of trades.**

### Subsidies
A **subsidy is a negative tax** where the government gives money to consumers (or producers). Some economic truths about subsidies:
1. Who gets the subsidy does not depend on who receives the check from the government
2. Who benefits from the subsidy does depend on the relative elasticities of demand and supply
3. Subsidies must be paid for by taxpayers and they create inefficient increases in trade (deadweight loss)
![](https://i.imgur.com/SN3EYEe.png)
When **demand is more elastic than supply, suppliers bear more of the burden of a tax and receive more of the benefit of a subsidy**

### Wage subsidies

## Price ceiling and floor
When buyers pay for gasoline in time, **the seller doesn't get the time. The time just gets wasted.**
### Effects
- Misallocation of resources
- Wasteful lines and other search costs
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ohjMc7a.png)Example
		* Suppose buyers value their time at $10/hr
		* Average fuel tank holds 20 gallons
		* Buyer arrives early and waits I hr
		* Total cost of gas = $1×20 gal + $10x1hr = $30
		* Implied cost per gallon = $30/20 = $1.50/gal
		* Remember that the value of gas is $3/gal
		* Buyers "bid" up the price by arriving earlier and earlier ⇒ ⬆️ time cost 
		* Line lengthens until total cost of 20 gallons equals $60 or $3/gallon, i.e. $20 money cost plus $40 time cost or 4 hours of waiting!
- Shortages

- Deadweight loss of trade gains
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Q3eXLSI.png)
- Reductions in product quality
	- With a surplus of buyers, sellers have less of an incentive to give good service
	- Another way to lower quality is to reduce service

## Price floors
Price floor - a minimum price allowed by law, they create:
1. Surpluses
2. Lost gains from trade (deadweight loss)
3. Wasteful increases in quality
4. A misallocation of resources
Price floors are less common than price ceilings.
![](https://i.imgur.com/vQa3MeC.png)
- The minimum wage creates a deadweight loss as it prohibits mutually profitable labor deals between buyers and sellers below the minimum wage.

### Rent controls
• Rent controls reduce housing quality
	• Owners respond to price control by cutting costs
	• Daily maintenance chores are cut
	• Repairs to elevators etc are delayed
• When rent controls are strong
	• Serviceable apartment buildings - slums
	• Slums -› abandoned and hollowed-out buildings
• Finding an apartment often involves a costly search
	• Rent controls reduce the price of discrimination
	• Landlords are able to discriminate without cost
	• Without controls sellers who discriminate bear a cost
• Bribes can be disquised
	• Charging extra for a "furnished" apartment
• Apartments are not allocated to the renters
who value them the most
	• Classic example: Older couple who stay in their large rent controlled apartment
• One study found: 21% of renters in NYC live in an apartment that has more or fewer rooms than they would choose if they lived in a city without rent controls

## Tariffs and protectionism
- Protectionism - the economic policy of restraining trade through tariffs, quotas or other regulations that burden foreign producers but not domestic producers
- Tariff - a tax on imports
- Quota - restriction on the quantity of goods that can be imported
![](https://i.imgur.com/3K2WZMs.png)

A tariff has two effects that influence welfare:
1. Domestic consumption ⬆️
	1. Domestic production ^

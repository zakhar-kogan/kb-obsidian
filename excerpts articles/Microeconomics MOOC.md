## 5 Factors that can change the demand
### Income
Income ⬆️ leads to demand ⬆️, but depends on the good. Demand curve shifts to the right and up.
For inferior goods ("poor" like instant ramen), income ⬆️ leads to demand ⬇️
### Population
### Tastes
Hamburgers or iPhones, for example
### Related goods
### Substitutes

### Complements

### Expectations
Say, batteries before a hurricane.

## Change in quantity demanded vs a change in demand
A change in quantity demanded refers to a change in the amount of a good or service that consumers are willing to buy at a given price, while a change in demand refers to a shift in the entire demand curve, which can be caused by a variety of factors such as changes in consumer preferences, income etc.

4.  **Elasticity**: The responsiveness of quantity demanded or quantity supplied to a change in price. The price elasticity of demand or the price elasticity of supply can measure elasticity.

## Elasticity of Supply
![](https://i.imgur.com/zu6trPY.png)
Determinants:
1. Change in Per-Unit Costs with Increased Production
	1. If increased production requires much higher costs, then the supply curve will be inelastic
	2. If production can increase with constant costs then the supply curve will be elastic
2. Time Horizon
	1. Immediately following a price increase, producers can expand output only using their current capacity (making supply inelastic)
	2. Over time, however, producers can expand their capacity (making supply elastic)
3. Share of Market for Inputs
	1. Supply is elastic when the industry is a small demander in its input markets because supply can be expanded without causing a big increase in the demand for the industry's inputs
4. Geographic Scope
	1. The narrower the scope of the market of a good, the more elastic its supply
	2. The wider the scope of the market of a good, the less elastic its supply

## Elasticity of Demand

The More Responsive Quantity Demanded is to a Change in Price, the More Elastic is the Demand Curve

### Determinants of the Elasticity of Demand
* Availability of Substitutes (this is the fundamental determinant)
   For goods with many substitutes, switching brands, when prices change, is EASY, so demand is elastic
* Time Horizon
   Immediately following a price increase, consumers may not be
able to alter their consumption patterns (making demand inelastic)
* Category of the product (specific or broad)
   The broader the classification, the less likely consumers will be to find a substitute (making demand inelastic)
* Necessities vs. Luxuries
   - For necessities, consumers do not change quantity demanded much when the price changes (making demand inelastic)
   - For luxuries, consumers will alter their behavior when the price rises (making demand elastic)
* Purchase Size
   - Consumers are less concerned about price changes when the good feels cheap (making demand inelastic)
	- Consumers become much more concerned about price changes when the good feels expensive (making demand elastic)

5.  **Consumer Surplus**: The difference between the maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay for a good or service and the actual price they pay. It is represented by the area above the demand curve and below the market price.

6.  **Producer Surplus**: The difference between the minimum amount a producer is willing to accept for a good or service and the actual price they receive. It is represented by the area above the market price and below the supply curve.

## Shifts in supply
### Innovation
Lowers costs and increases supply
### Increase in unit price
Decreases supply
### Taxes
Increase cost, decrease supply
### Subsidies
Decrease cost and increase supply
### Expectations
Of a higher price: increase cost of supplying now
### Entry or exit of producers
### Opportunity costs

* How does the price of oil affect the price of
candy bars?
* Higher oil prices -> ethanol ⬆️ -› more sugar cane for ethanol less for sugar -› price of sugar ⬆️ -> cost of producing candy bars ⬆️

## Great economic problem
- Great Economic Problem - how to arrange our limited resource to satisfy as many of our wants as possible
- Resources are not equally valuable in all uses
Solving: 
- Central planning: a single official or bureaucracy is responsible for allocating limited resources
	- Too much information to process
	- Too few incentives

## Information problem

## Speculation

## Externalities

• Private cost: paid by consumer or producer
• External cost: paid by bystanders, not consumer/producer
• Social cost: private cost + external cost
• Externalities: external costs/benefits impacting bystanders

- A market maximizes consumer surplus + producer surplus
- An external cost is a cost that falls on bystanders not on consumers or producers
- Social surplus = consumer surplus + producer surplus + bystander's surplus
![](https://i.imgur.com/HBTdiEG.png)
Solution: a Pigouvian tax - a tax on a good with external costs
![](https://i.imgur.com/ybfrbK4.png)

### External benefits
![](https://i.imgur.com/ERdPiA4.png)

- Conclusion: Market equilibrium output is too low when a good has external benefits.
- For efficiency: Include all benefits, not just private benefits. Account for external benefits too.
- Solution: Impose a Pigouvian subsidy on the good equal to the external benefit. This incentivizes more production and the efficient output level.

### Trade
* Trade makes people better off when preferences differ
* Trade increases productivity through specialization and the division of knowledge
* Trade increases productivity through specialization according to comparative advantage
### Comparative advantage
![](https://i.imgur.com/OFEVQKg.png)
In two country/person examples everyone is better off. In larger examples, trade increases aggregate wealth but some individuals can be made worse off.

## Taxes
![](https://i.imgur.com/BNTVpsF.png)

Since it **doesn't matter whether buyers or sellers are taxed**, we can graph the tax as a simple "wedge":
![](https://i.imgur.com/0amonL4.png)

* The more elastic side of the market will pay a smaller share of a tax (smaller burden)
* The less elastic (more inelastic) side of the market will pay a greater share of a tax (greater burden)
* Elastic demand means that demanders have good substitutes for the taxed good and so can escape the tax
* Elastic supply means that the resources used to produce the taxed good can easily be moved to other industries so they can escape the tax
* Someone, however, must pay the tax so the relative elasticities determine the burden

### Tax revenue and deadweight loss
![](https://i.imgur.com/cXmJKb9.png)

We want to **tax inelastic demand goods**:
![](https://i.imgur.com/i1Xxxyf.png)
**If the tax is inelastic, we won't deter a lot of trades.**

### Subsidies
A **subsidy is a negative tax** where the government gives money to consumers (or producers). Some economic truths about subsidies:
1. Who gets the subsidy does not depend on who receives the check from the government
2. Who benefits from the subsidy does depend on the relative elasticities of demand and supply
3. Subsidies must be paid for by taxpayers and they create inefficient increases in trade (deadweight loss)
![](https://i.imgur.com/SN3EYEe.png)
When **demand is more elastic than supply, suppliers bear more of the burden of a tax and receive more of the benefit of a subsidy**

### Wage subsidies

## Price ceiling and floor
When buyers pay for gasoline in time, **the seller doesn't get the time. The time just gets wasted.**
### Effects
- Misallocation of resources
- Wasteful lines and other search costs
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ohjMc7a.png)Example
		* Suppose buyers value their time at $10/hr
		* Average fuel tank holds 20 gallons
		* Buyer arrives early and waits I hr
		* Total cost of gas = $1×20 gal + $10x1hr = $30
		* Implied cost per gallon = $30/20 = $1.50/gal
		* Remember that the value of gas is $3/gal
		* Buyers "bid" up the price by arriving earlier and earlier ⇒ ⬆️ time cost 
		* Line lengthens until total cost of 20 gallons equals $60 or $3/gallon, i.e. $20 money cost plus $40 time cost or 4 hours of waiting!
- Shortages

- Deadweight loss of trade gains
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Q3eXLSI.png)
- Reductions in product quality
	- With a surplus of buyers, sellers have less of an incentive to give good service
	- Another way to lower quality is to reduce service

## Price floors
Price floor - a minimum price allowed by law, they create:
1. Surpluses
2. Lost gains from trade (deadweight loss)
3. Wasteful increases in quality
4. A misallocation of resources
Price floors are less common than price ceilings.
![](https://i.imgur.com/vQa3MeC.png)
- The minimum wage creates a deadweight loss as it prohibits mutually profitable labor deals between buyers and sellers below the minimum wage.

### Rent controls
• Rent controls reduce housing quality
	• Owners respond to price control by cutting costs
	• Daily maintenance chores are cut
	• Repairs to elevators etc are delayed
• When rent controls are strong
	• Serviceable apartment buildings - slums
	• Slums -› abandoned and hollowed-out buildings
• Finding an apartment often involves a costly search
	• Rent controls reduce the price of discrimination
	• Landlords are able to discriminate without cost
	• Without controls sellers who discriminate bear a cost
• Bribes can be disquised
	• Charging extra for a "furnished" apartment
• Apartments are not allocated to the renters
who value them the most
	• Classic example: Older couple who stay in their large rent controlled apartment
• One study found: 21% of renters in NYC live in an apartment that has more or fewer rooms than they would choose if they lived in a city without rent controls

## Tariffs and protectionism
- Protectionism - the economic policy of restraining trade through tariffs, quotas or other regulations that burden foreign producers but not domestic producers
- Tariff - a tax on imports
- Quota - restriction on the quantity of goods that can be imported
![](https://i.imgur.com/3K2WZMs.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/5PHJGLB.png)

A **tariff** has two effects that influence **welfare**:
* Domestic consumption ⬇
* Domestic production ⬆️
**Both** of these effects **reduce** welfare
- Domestic consumption ⬇️
	- Lost gains from trade
- Domestic production ⬆️
	- Wasted resources from higher-cost production
![](https://i.imgur.com/KM1Upmd.png)

- Tariffs increase prices to consumers so domestic consumption falls and this creates a deadweight loss
- Tariffs divert production from low-cost (world) producers to high-cost (domestic) producers and this waste resources
Distribution of losses and gains
- Bad for consumers
- Good for domestic producers
- Bad overall

## Against international trade
Some of the most common arguments:
- Trade reduces the number of jobs in the U.S.
- It's wrong to trade with countries that use child labor
- We need to keep certain jobs at home for national security
- We need to keep certain "key" industries at home because of beneficial spillovers onto other sectors of the economy
- We can increase U.S. well-being with strategic trade protectionism

### Arguments for
- Trade moves jobs from import-competing industries to exporting industries
- Wages increase on average due to comparative advantage
- Problems can occur, however, when we lose jobs in low-skill import-competing sectors and gain jobs in high-skill export sectors

### Child labor
- Child labor was common in 19th-century Great Britain and the U.S.
- Child labor declined in the developed world as people got richer
- Forces that reduced child labor in the developed world are at work in the developing countries

![](https://i.imgur.com/j8Kgh6R.png)

Possible for a country to use tariffs and quotas to get a larger share of the gains from trade
- Done by limiting or taxing exports
- Allows domestic firms to act as cartel when selling to international buyers
- Can be effective if there are few substitutes for U.S. produced goods
- Not such a great idea if other countries can retaliate

- Restrictions on trade waste resources by transferring production from low-cost foreign producers to high-cost domestic producers
- Restrictions on trade also prevent domestic consumers from exploiting gains from trade
- Some arguments for restricting trade are valid, but are usually of limited applicability

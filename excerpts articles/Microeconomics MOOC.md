## 5 Factors that can change the demand
### Income
Income ⬆️ leads to demand ⬆️, but depends on the good. Demand curve shifts to the right and up.
For inferior goods ("poor" like instant ramen), income ⬆️ leads to demand ⬇️
### Population
### Tastes
Hamburgers or iPhones, for example
### Related goods
### Substitutes

### Complements

### Expectations
Say, batteries before a hurricane.

## Change in quantity demanded vs a change in demand
A change in quantity demanded refers to a change in the amount of a good or service that consumers are willing to buy at a given price, while a change in demand refers to a shift in the entire demand curve, which can be caused by a variety of factors such as changes in consumer preferences, income etc.
![](https://i.imgur.com/jc5zQhv.png)

4.  **Elasticity**: The responsiveness of quantity demanded or quantity supplied to a change in price. The price elasticity of demand or the price elasticity of supply can measure elasticity.

## Elasticity of Supply
![](https://i.imgur.com/zu6trPY.png)
Determinants:
1. Change in Per-Unit Costs with Increased Production
	1. If increased production requires much higher costs, then the supply curve will be inelastic
	2. If production can increase with constant costs then the supply curve will be elastic
2. Time Horizon
	1. Immediately following a price increase, producers can expand output only using their current capacity (making supply inelastic)
	2. Over time, however, producers can expand their capacity (making supply elastic)
3. Share of Market for Inputs
	1. Supply is elastic when the industry is a small demander in its input markets because supply can be expanded without causing a big increase in the demand for the industry's inputs
4. Geographic Scope
	1. The narrower the scope of the market of a good, the more elastic its supply
	2. The wider the scope of the market of a good, the less elastic its supply

## Elasticity of Demand
![](https://i.imgur.com/8Qq0q9w.png)

The More Responsive Quantity Demanded is to a Change in Price, the More Elastic is the Demand Curve

### Determinants of the Elasticity of Demand
* Availability of Substitutes (this is the fundamental determinant)
   For goods with many substitutes, switching brands, when prices change, is EASY, so demand is elastic
* Time Horizon
   Immediately following a price increase, consumers may not be
able to alter their consumption patterns (making demand inelastic)
* Category of the product (specific or broad)
   The broader the classification, the less likely consumers will be to find a substitute (making demand inelastic)
* Necessities vs. Luxuries
   - For necessities, consumers do not change quantity demanded much when the price changes (making demand inelastic)
   - For luxuries, consumers will alter their behavior when the price rises (making demand elastic)
* Purchase Size
   - Consumers are less concerned about price changes when the good feels cheap (making demand inelastic)
	- Consumers become much more concerned about price changes when the good feels expensive (making demand elastic)

5.  **Consumer Surplus**: The difference between the maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay for a good or service and the actual price they pay. It is represented by the area above the demand curve and below the market price.

6.  **Producer Surplus**: The difference between the minimum amount a producer is willing to accept for a good or service and the actual price they receive. It is represented by the area above the market price and below the supply curve.

## Shifts in supply
### Innovation
Lowers costs and increases supply
### Increase in unit price
Decreases supply
### Taxes
Increase cost, decrease supply
### Subsidies
Decrease cost and increase supply
### Expectations
Of a higher price: increase cost of supplying now
### Entry or exit of producers
### Opportunity costs

* How does the price of oil affect the price of
candy bars?
* Higher oil prices -> ethanol ⬆️ -› more sugar cane for ethanol less for sugar -› price of sugar ⬆️ -> cost of producing candy bars ⬆️

## Great economic problem
- Great Economic Problem - how to arrange our limited resource to satisfy as many of our wants as possible
- Resources are not equally valuable in all uses
Solving: 
- Central planning: a single official or bureaucracy is responsible for allocating limited resources
	- Too much information to process
	- Too few incentives

## Information problem
![](https://i.imgur.com/xSoAt7h.png)

## Speculation
![](https://i.imgur.com/5Bzc5YS.png)

## Externalities

• Private cost: paid by consumer or producer
• External cost: paid by bystanders, not consumer/producer
• Social cost: private cost + external cost
• Externalities: external costs/benefits impacting bystanders

- A market maximizes consumer surplus + producer surplus
- An external cost is a cost that falls on bystanders not on consumers or producers
- Social surplus = consumer surplus + producer surplus + bystander's surplus
![](https://i.imgur.com/HBTdiEG.png)
Solution: a Pigouvian tax - a tax on a good with external costs
![](https://i.imgur.com/ybfrbK4.png)

### External benefits
![](https://i.imgur.com/ERdPiA4.png)

- Conclusion: Market equilibrium output is too low when a good has external benefits.
- For efficiency: Include all benefits, not just private benefits. Account for external benefits too.
- Solution: Impose a Pigouvian subsidy on the good equal to the external benefit. This incentivizes more production and the efficient output level.

### Command and control
- Command and control
  - Good solution when:
    - Best approach to problem is well known
    - Strong compliance is necessary (flexibility is not a good thing)
    - Example: Eradication of smallpox.
  - Rarely efficient
  	  - Multiple methods to achieve goals (e.g. reducing electricity use)
  	  - Government lacks information for least cost method
  	  - Command and control vs. tax
  	  - Tax on electricity allows users to find low cost methods
  	  - Few people would pay more for an inefficient washer
  	  - Goal: Reduce pollution, not necessarily use less electricity.

### Coase theorem
- Coase theorem and externalities
  - Conditions may not always be met
  - Suggests alternative approach: creation of new markets
  - Solution: If government can:
    - Define property rights
    - Reduce transaction costs
  - Markets can be used to control externality problems.

### Tradable allowances, pollution
- Result of the SO (trading program)
  - Clean energy firms earn money by selling allowances
  - Dirty energy firms must buy allowances
  - Result
    - Clean energy is subsidized (not by taxpayers)
    - Dirty energy is taxed.


## Trade
* Trade makes people better off when preferences differ
* Trade increases productivity through specialization and the division of knowledge
* Trade increases productivity through specialization according to comparative advantage
### Comparative advantage
![](https://i.imgur.com/OFEVQKg.png)
In two country/person examples everyone is better off. In larger examples, trade increases aggregate wealth but some individuals can be made worse off.

## Taxes
![](https://i.imgur.com/BNTVpsF.png)

Since it **doesn't matter whether buyers or sellers are taxed**, we can graph the tax as a simple "wedge":
![](https://i.imgur.com/0amonL4.png)

* The more elastic side of the market will pay a smaller share of a tax (smaller burden)
* The less elastic (more inelastic) side of the market will pay a greater share of a tax (greater burden)
* Elastic demand means that demanders have good substitutes for the taxed good and so can escape the tax
* Elastic supply means that the resources used to produce the taxed good can easily be moved to other industries so they can escape the tax
* Someone, however, must pay the tax so the relative elasticities determine the burden

### Tax revenue and deadweight loss
![](https://i.imgur.com/cXmJKb9.png)

We want to **tax inelastic demand goods**:
![](https://i.imgur.com/i1Xxxyf.png)
**If the tax is inelastic, we won't deter a lot of trades.**

### Subsidies
A **subsidy is a negative tax** where the government gives money to consumers (or producers). Some economic truths about subsidies:
1. Who gets the subsidy does not depend on who receives the check from the government
2. Who benefits from the subsidy does depend on the relative elasticities of demand and supply
3. Subsidies must be paid for by taxpayers and they create inefficient increases in trade (deadweight loss)
![](https://i.imgur.com/SN3EYEe.png)
When **demand is more elastic than supply, suppliers bear more of the burden of a tax and receive more of the benefit of a subsidy**

### Wage subsidies
![](https://i.imgur.com/9WktNBW.png)

## Price ceiling and floor
When buyers pay for gasoline in time, **the seller doesn't get the time. The time just gets wasted.**
### Effects
- Misallocation of resources
- Wasteful lines and other search costs
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/ohjMc7a.png)Example
		* Suppose buyers value their time at $10/hr
		* Average fuel tank holds 20 gallons
		* Buyer arrives early and waits I hr
		* Total cost of gas = $1×20 gal + $10x1hr = $30
		* Implied cost per gallon = $30/20 = $1.50/gal
		* Remember that the value of gas is $3/gal
		* Buyers "bid" up the price by arriving earlier and earlier ⇒ ⬆️ time cost 
		* Line lengthens until total cost of 20 gallons equals $60 or $3/gallon, i.e. $20 money cost plus $40 time cost or 4 hours of waiting!
- Shortages
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/DHf4zcr.png)
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/dXcV6pJ.png)

- Deadweight loss of trade gains
	- ![](https://i.imgur.com/Q3eXLSI.png)
- Reductions in product quality
	- With a surplus of buyers, sellers have less of an incentive to give good service
	- Another way to lower quality is to reduce service

## Price floors
Price floor - a minimum price allowed by law, they create:
1. Surpluses
2. Lost gains from trade (deadweight loss)
3. Wasteful increases in quality
4. A misallocation of resources
Price floors are less common than price ceilings.
![](https://i.imgur.com/vQa3MeC.png)
- The minimum wage creates a deadweight loss as it prohibits mutually profitable labor deals between buyers and sellers below the minimum wage.

### Rent controls
• Rent controls reduce housing quality
	• Owners respond to price control by cutting costs
	• Daily maintenance chores are cut
	• Repairs to elevators etc are delayed
• When rent controls are strong
	• Serviceable apartment buildings - slums
	• Slums -› abandoned and hollowed-out buildings
• Finding an apartment often involves a costly search
	• Rent controls reduce the price of discrimination
	• Landlords are able to discriminate without cost
	• Without controls sellers who discriminate bear a cost
• Bribes can be disquised
	• Charging extra for a "furnished" apartment
• Apartments are not allocated to the renters
who value them the most
	• Classic example: Older couple who stay in their large rent controlled apartment
• One study found: 21% of renters in NYC live in an apartment that has more or fewer rooms than they would choose if they lived in a city without rent controls

## Tariffs and protectionism
- Protectionism - the economic policy of restraining trade through tariffs, quotas or other regulations that burden foreign producers but not domestic producers
- Tariff - a tax on imports
- Quota - restriction on the quantity of goods that can be imported
![](https://i.imgur.com/3K2WZMs.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/5PHJGLB.png)

A **tariff** has two effects that influence **welfare**:
* Domestic consumption ⬇
* Domestic production ⬆️
**Both** of these effects **reduce** welfare
- Domestic consumption ⬇️
	- Lost gains from trade
- Domestic production ⬆️
	- Wasted resources from higher-cost production
![](https://i.imgur.com/KM1Upmd.png)

- Tariffs increase prices to consumers so domestic consumption falls and this creates a deadweight loss
- Tariffs divert production from low-cost (world) producers to high-cost (domestic) producers and this waste resources
Distribution of losses and gains
- Bad for consumers
- Good for domestic producers
- Bad overall
> See Cowen and Tabarrok. Modern Principles of Economics.

## Against international trade
Some of the most common arguments:
- Trade reduces the number of jobs in the U.S.
- It's wrong to trade with countries that use child labor
- We need to keep certain jobs at home for national security
- We need to keep certain "key" industries at home because of beneficial spillovers onto other sectors of the economy
- We can increase U.S. well-being with strategic trade protectionism

### Arguments for
- Trade moves jobs from import-competing industries to exporting industries
- Wages increase on average due to comparative advantage
- Problems can occur, however, when we lose jobs in low-skill import-competing sectors and gain jobs in high-skill export sectors

### Child labor
- Child labor was common in 19th-century Great Britain and the U.S.
- Child labor declined in the developed world as people got richer
- Forces that reduced child labor in the developed world are at work in the developing countries

![](https://i.imgur.com/j8Kgh6R.png)

Possible for a country to use tariffs and quotas to get a larger share of the gains from trade
- Done by limiting or taxing exports
- Allows domestic firms to act as cartel when selling to international buyers
- Can be effective if there are few substitutes for U.S. produced goods
- Not such a great idea if other countries can retaliate

- Restrictions on trade waste resources by transferring production from low-cost foreign producers to high-cost domestic producers
- Restrictions on trade also prevent domestic consumers from exploiting gains from trade
- Some arguments for restricting trade are valid, but are usually of limited applicability

## Competition
![](https://i.imgur.com/3uqlGGr.png)

Characteristics:
* The product is similar across sellers
* There are many buyers and sellers, each small relative to the total market
OR
- There are many potential sellers

![](https://i.imgur.com/H3gl7LX.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/CUIJW3U.png)

### Maximizing profit
![](https://i.imgur.com/V54DleG.png)

- Marginal Revenue (MR) = the addition to total revenue from selling an additional unit of output
- Marginal Cost (MC) = the addition to total cost from producing an additional unit of output

==MR = MC is profit-maximizing==
- If MR > MC, producing more will increase profit
- If MR < MC, producing less will increase profit
At MR = MC, profit can't be increased by changing quantity, so this is the profit-maximizing level of output.

![](https://i.imgur.com/zt7xNPc.png)


- We know how to find the profit-maximizing quantity (where MR = MC)
- Now we want to know the size of the profit
- Average cost (AC) is total cost divided by quantity (TC/Q)
- Adding the AC curve to the graph shows profit (P = TR - TC)
- The profit-maximizing quantity is where P = MR - AC is highest

### Average Cost Curve
![](https://i.imgur.com/jmZGUgV.png)

We know that T = TR - TC, and TR = (P x Q). We also know that AC = (TC/Q) and we can rearrange this to find TC = AC
![](https://i.imgur.com/PL1iYDt.png)

```
TR = P * Q
TC = AC * Q

profit = TR - TC
profit = (P * Q) - (AC * Q)
profit = (P - AC) * Q
```

![](https://i.imgur.com/g9HgeNP.png)

• It doesn't always make sense to exit an industry immediately when P < AC or enter immediately when P > AC
• Why? Entry and exit costs
• E.g. Entry means drilling an oil well
• Costs of drilling an oil well are sunk costs
• Sunk costs - A cost that once incurred can never be recovered
• Don't enter unless PExpected > min AC long enough to also cover your entry costs

![](https://i.imgur.com/9ZgVg9a.png)

• The supply curve is built upon firm entry and exit decisions and the effect of these decisions on industry costs
• As industry output increases, what happens to costs?
• Increasing cost industry - Industry costs increase with greater output
• Constant cost industry - Industry costs do not change with greater output
• Decreasing cost industry - Industry costs decrease with greater output

### Constant costs

### Decreasing costs

## Trade

### Comparative advantage

![](https://i.imgur.com/lCvLhJs.png)

• In two country/person examples, everyone is better off. In larger examples, trade increases aggregate wealth, but some individuals can be made worse off.
• Comparative advantage applies to people, groups, and countries. Law of Association.
• Diversity is a strength

### Competitive firms
Characteristics:
• The product is similar across sellers
• There are many buyers and sellers, each small relative to the total market, or there are many potential sellers

### Maximizing profit under competition
![](https://i.imgur.com/Ie8Q4q6.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/FteNKJo.png)
• Profits are maximized at the level of output where MR = MC
Why?
• If MR > MC, you are not profit-maximizing, producing more will add to your profit
• If MR < MC, you are not profit-maximizing, producing less will add to your profit

![](https://i.imgur.com/KzAdyii.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/dmvTLKO.png)
![](https://i.imgur.com/jR0uvVq.png)

• When should a firm enter or exit an industry?
• Long run
	• Firms will enter the industry when P > AC
	• Firms will exit the industry when P < AC
• When P = Min AC
	• Profits are zero
	• No incentive to either exit or enter the industry

### Increasing costs
• Any industry where it is difficult to duplicate exactly
inputs
	• E.g.
	• Oil
	• Copper, Gold, Silver
	• Coffee
	• Nuclear engineers
• Any industry that buys a large fraction of the output of an increasing cost industry will also be an increasing cost industry
• E.g.: Gasoline industry - ^ demand for gas -› ^ price of oil -›
^ price of gas

• Increasing cost industry - upward sloped supply curve
• Constant cost industry - flat (horizontal) supply curve
• Decreasing cost industry - downward sloped supply curve

### Decreasing costs

![](https://i.imgur.com/Wl2xYMA.png)

## Competition and the invisible hand
• Invisible Hand Property 1: Competitive markets balance production across firms in an industry so that total industry costs are minimized (for any given quantity of production)
• Invisible Hand Property 2: Entry and exit decisions balance production across different industries so that the total value of production is maximized

![](https://i.imgur.com/loYCJM5.png)

## Monopoly
> Example:
>	• GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) owns the patent on Combivir which gives it the right to exclude competitors. Only GSK can sell Combivir.
	• The patent gives GSK Market Power - the power to raise price above marginal cost without fear that other firms will enter the market

![](https://i.imgur.com/aAi7E6o.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/Vcqd8Ia.png)

#### Steps to find Monopoly profit
1. Find Marginal Revenue
2. Set MR -MC to find Q*
3. Find P*
4. Find total revenue and total costs
5. Find profit

#### Marginal revenue

### Monopoly markup
• Two effects increase the monopoly markup for pharmaceuticals:
• The "you can't take it with you" effect
	• People with serious illnesses are relatively insensitive to the price of life saving medicine
• The "other people's money" effect
	• If third parties are paying for the medicine, people are less sensitive to price
• Conclusion: The less sensitive quantity demanded is to price the higher the markup, i.e. the more inelastic the demand the higher the monopoly markup

![](https://i.imgur.com/2mTkemG.png)

## Rumination to action
If you notice yourself ruminating (ezpz) -> ask yourself in an [ACTy](https://t.me/ohmyboi/668) way: 
- "Is this within my control?"
- "What can I do about it?"
- Start the action
## Allocate time for worrying
- Allocate a short period (5-15 minutes) to worry
- Write intrusive thoughts
- Shift to what's within your control and get to action
- If something bogs you throughout the day ⇒ "I'll worry about that in the dedicated time"
Having structure may help.
## Reframe negative thoughts
- When you notice a negative thought like "You're going to fail",
- Reframe it as, say, "I'll try my best, learn things and that's important for growth"
## Achievement addiction
### Signs
- You're a workaholic and work compulsively
- You prioritize work/achievements over wellbeing and family
- After achieving anything, you're already thinking of the next goal/task
- You feel guilty when you stop working
- Your sense of self and self-worth is so closely tied with your work that you start to believe you are your achievements
- You feel short of time
### Actions
- Mindful [leisure and off](https://betterhumans.pub/how-to-rest-better-d1c1eabb6c5f) time
- Limiting working time to somewhere during the day
- Surround yourself with people who value you
## Cognitive reframing
- Avoid absolutes, like "never" or "always"
- Change language intensity ('this is the worst thing' ⇒ 'it's challenging but I'm learning')
- Change from 'why' to 'what' ('why is this happening to me' ⇒ 'what can I do about it')

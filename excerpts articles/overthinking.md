## Rumination to action
If you notice yourself ruminating (ezpz) -> ask yourself in an [ACTy](https://t.me/ohmyboi/668) way: 
- "Is this within my control?"
- "What can I do about it?"
- Start the action
## Allocate time for worrying
- Allocate a short period (5-15 minutes) to worry
- Write intrusive thoughts
- Shift to what's within your control and get to action
- If something bogs you throughout the day â‡’ "I'll worry about that in the dedicated time"
Having structure may help.
## Reframe negative thoughts
- When you notice a negative thought like "You're going to fail",
- Reframe it as, say, "I'll try my best, learn things and that's important for growth"

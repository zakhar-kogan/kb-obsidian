People judge you by two things: warmth and competence.
It's more important to show warmth first, then competence - especially in business settings.

## Tips
### Warmth
- Open body language
- Face people you speak with
- Smile
- Show people you're interested (active listening)
- Then, back it up with competence
### Competence
- Appropriate eye contact
- Confident posture
- Confident hansdhake

## Connection
A sense of connection occurs when our self|others perception is blurred. Mirroring is a good technique to channel connection:
- Scan the environment to understand the situation. What's the other person's state?
- Is it appropriate to mirror their state?
- If appropriate, align your approach to them:
	- Body language
	- Pace of speech
	- Intonation
	- Volume
- Make sure it's subtle and comes from a desire to connect, not manipulate
## The good in others
What you say about others influences their perception of you (duh), a phenomena called **spontaneous trait transference**.

Likely to highlight others' positive traits -> people will likely perceive you in a positive light. And vice versa.

### Actions
Actively seek good in others and highlight it.

## Using someone's name
Tips to better remember names:
- Clarify spelling ("Is that Catherine with a K or C?")
- Repeat in conversation a couple of times
- Make an association

[[Charisma]]
People judge you by two things: warmth and competence.
It's more important to show warmth first, then competence - especially in business settings.
## Tips
### Warmth
- Open body language
- Face people you speak with
- Smile
- Show people you're interested (active listening)
- Then, back it up with competence
### Competence
- Appropriate eye contact
- Confident posture
- Confident hansdhake
## Connection
A sense of connection occurs when our self|others perception is blurred. Mirroring is a good technique to channel connection:
- Scan the environment to understand the situation. What's the other person's state?
- Is it appropriate to mirror their state?
- If appropriate, align your approach to them:
	- Body language
	- Pace of speech
	- Intonation
	- Volume
- Make sure it's subtle and comes from a desire to connect, not manipulate
## The good in others
What you say about others influences their perception of you (duh), a phenomena called **spontaneous trait transference**.

Likely to highlight others' positive traits -> people will likely perceive you in a positive light. And vice versa.
### Actions
Actively seek good in others and highlight it.
## Using someone's name
Tips to better remember names:
- Clarify spelling ("Is that Catherine with a K or C?")
- Repeat in conversation a couple of times
- Make an association
## Charismatic presence
### Energizing others
Trait affective presence -> are you easy to be around? Do people like being around you?

People respond to our social cues -> associate those emotions with us. 
### Connecting through commonality
Creating a good impression in one area influences perception of you in other areas -> halo effect.

Find something in common -> talk about it a little bit.

Commonality connects.
### Eye contact
Eye contact is one of the greatest indicators of confidence, translating into charisma.
- Establishes connection
- Shows sincerity
- Projects self-esteem
- Projects credibility
Proper eye contant can make you appear more
- Likable
- Attentive
- Attractive
- Memorable
This varies culturally -> pay attention to that.
## Communication
### Pausing
Super simple way of increasing charisma: 3SP, three-second pause.

Translates into quiet confidence - some people naturally *pause before answering*. They remain silent maintaining eye contact for ~3 seconds.
- Time to collect thoughts
- Translates confidence and self-assurance
A great tip for business or nervous environments.
### [[Presentation]]
- Create suspence
	- With composure, walk to the center of the room
	- Lock eyes with the audience
	- Make a deep breath
	- When everyone is quiet and waiting for what's gonna happen next, continue
### Simplify your language
Using *sophisticated words makes you less credible* in the eyes of the others + alienates you with the people you're speaking with.
Charismatic people talk:
- Relatable
- Simple
Say, [like Mr. Feynman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EyssfKRsgMU).

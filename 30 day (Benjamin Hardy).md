## DAY 6:

**Key Insight:** If you want extreme flow and motivation, you need to identify and commit to a single "Keystone Goal." One goal is how you change your life because one goal gives you a clear path to your future. If you have too many goals, you will have too many competing paths, which is another word for decision fatigue. True decision means you've cut-off alternative paths. This is how you create motivation and success.

### Challenge:

-**What is your Keystone Goal? What's the one outcome that, if it were real, would allow you to do everything else you want to do?**

## DAY 7:

**Key Insight:** Commitment is reflected in the results you're getting. If you're serious about becoming your desired future self, it's time to pass your point of no return. It's time to remove alternative "lesser" goals. Commitment precedes courage, and it takes courage to become your future self. You ready to commit?

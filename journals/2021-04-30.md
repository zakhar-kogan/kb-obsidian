[RPL554](https://www.labiotech.eu/more-news/cystic-fibrosis-gene-therapy/) is an inhaled treatment that acts as both a **bronchodilator** and an **anti-inflammatory agent**, a feat no other available treatment has been able to match. The drug achieves these two functions through a unique mechanism of action.Â By using a **dual inhibitor**, the drug can target two disease-related enzymes (**[PDE3](PDE3)** and **[PDE4](PDE4.md)**) simultaneously.

	- We can frame **token design as optimization design**, then use optimization design methodology.
	- **Simulation, verification, and design space exploration (CAD tools) **for circuit design have helped engineers analyze, design, and verify wickedly complex chips. We can look forward to similar tools for tokenized ecosystems.
	- When you have an appropriately timed force applied to a system in resonance, the amplitude of the resonance *grows *over time.
	- However, it turns out that if you zoom in on Mechanism Design with a [few practical constraints](https://medium.com/blockchannel/a-crash-course-in-mechanism-design-for-cryptoeconomic-applications-a9f06ab6a976), you end up with Optimization Design! People doing Optimization Design have a tremendous amount of practical experience deploying optimizer systems over the years.

	- We can frame **token design as optimization design**, then use optimization design methodology.
	- **Simulation, verification, and design space exploration (CAD tools) **for circuit design have helped engineers analyze, design, and verify wickedly complex chips. We can look forward to similar tools for tokenized ecosystems.
	- When you have an appropriately timed force applied to a system in resonance, the amplitude of the resonance *grows *over time.
	- However, it turns out that if you zoom in on Mechanism Design with a [few practical constraints](https://medium.com/blockchannel/a-crash-course-in-mechanism-design-for-cryptoeconomic-applications-a9f06ab6a976), you end up with Optimization Design! People doing Optimization Design have a tremendous amount of practical experience deploying optimizer systems over the years.

	- Token design is like optimization design: at a high level, you encode intent with a block rewards function aka objective function, and you let it fly. As is often the case, [Simon de la Rouviere](https://medium.com/@simondlr) [saw this one first](https://hackernoon.com/history-is-rhyming-fitness-functions-comparing-blockchain-tokens-to-the-web-3c117239f4c).
	- It gets more specific than that. Token design is *especially *like evolutionary algorithms (EAs), where there are many agents “searching” at once and there is no top-down control of what each agent does. Agents live and die by their block reward or fitness.
	- With such similarities, *we can use best practices from optimization / EA to when doing token design*. This is great news, because many people are Jedis in designing EAs and optimization systems.

		- Goals
			- Both tokenized ecosystems and EAs have **goals**, in the form of **objectives **(things to maximize or minimize) and **constraints **(things that must be met). To get fancy, this can even be stochastic.
			- The tokenized ecosystem might give block rewards for an objective function of “maximize hash rate” whereas an EA objective might be “minimize error” in training a deep net. Constraints might be “must have stake ≥threshold to participate” or “deep network layers=100” respectively.
			- Variants include single-objective optimization (1 objective, 0 constraints), constraint satisfaction (0 objectives, ≥1 constraints), and multi-objective constrained optimization (≥2 objectives, ≥1 constraints).

		- The [[brain]] is very plastic and has been shown to change as required to
		  enhance its ability to deal with a challenge.
		- [[brain]] [[exercise]] is a basic [[brain]] repair and growth promoting technique.
		  Education level increases age of AD onset. Physical [[exercise]] increases [[brain]] angiogenesis. [[brain]] [[exercise]] increases synaptogenesis and angiogenesis. Memory increases correlate with synaptic number increase. [[brain]] nuclei volume has been shown to increase with [[brain]] use.
		- [[brain]] activity can be measured non-invasively by cerebral tissue oxygenation and by [[brain]] [[blood]] temperature. fMRI measures the magnetic moment of deoxygenated hemoglobin and is an accepted scientific standard of [[brain]] activity. [[blood]] temperature has been shown to correlate highly with [[brain]] metabolism. The Fick method of measuring energy use of the [[brain]], the gold standard, depends on oxygen depletion in exiting venous [[blood]] vs. newly entering arterial oxygenated [[blood]].
		- [[brain]] activity is controlled voluntarily. Every voluntary body action or thought is consciously controlled. Body action/thought can be initiated by intent. [[blood]] flow increases in affected [[brain]] nuclei to [[supply]] the energy that fuels the [[brain]] for [[life]] support, actions and thought.
		- Brain tissue oxygenation is easily measured by an external light operated spectrophotometer. Brain blood temperature, affected by brain metabolism, can also be used to train brain improvement. It is measurable with an
		  infrared radiation sensitive thermometer.

		- Overtraining can have some negative side-affects these include headaches and anxiety. Make sure you don’t overtrain and over [[stress]] the [[brain]] as I said before start low with 3 minutes per site and then move up to 5 minutes per site every other day after around a month’s [[training]].  Far too many [[People]] overtrain when it comes to [[heg]] and it’s just not worth it.

			- You’ll start to have some communication overhead
			- This is when you realize that your role is morphing
			- 2-5 engineers you still have ~70% time to code
			- 5-10 engineers, you’ll be only coding <50%

			- **Affiliate businesses**
			  Too far away from the transaction
			- **Hardware businesses**

				- Can’t scale a leaky bucket:
					- 95% monthly retention = 54% annual retention
					- 90% monthly retention = 28% annual retention

	- Two of the relatively well-known database models are the hierarchical and network models. Hierarchical models involve “a data structure in which the elements of the structure have only one-to-many relationships with one another”

	- Similarly, Kroenke [11] defines a network database structure is one “in which at least one of the
	  relationships is many-to-many.”

	- One of the most commonly used database structures is the relational database model. As the name implies the relational database model “has the relation at its heart, but then a whole series of rules governing keys, relationships, joins, functional dependencies, transitive dependencies, multi-valued dependencies, and modification anomalies” [14 The Relational Data Model, para. 1].

	- Normalization is a major challenge in RDBMS design. Kroenke [10] defines normalization as “a
	  process for converting a relation that has certain problems to two or more relations that do not have these problems.” Much is written about tips for normalizing a database and many authors note that an RDBMS is not the best database design for all types of data. Even in more recent writings by the father of the RDBMS, Codd [5] admits that a “relational

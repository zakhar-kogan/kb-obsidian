	- Two of the relatively well-known database models are the ==hierarchical and network models.== Hierarchical models involve “a data structure in which the elements of the structure have only one-to-many relationships with one another”

	- Similarly, Kroenke [11] defines a network database structure is one “in which at least one of the
	  relationships is many-to-many.”

	- One of the most commonly used database structures is the ==relational database model==. As the name implies the relational database model “has the relation at its heart, but then a whole series of rules governing keys, relationships, joins, functional dependencies, transitive dependencies, multi-valued dependencies, and modification anomalies” [14 The Relational Data Model, para. 1].

	- Normalization is a major challenge in RDBMS design. Kroenke [10] defines normalization as “a
	  process for converting a relation that has certain problems to two or more relations that do not have these problems.” Much is written about tips for normalizing a database and many authors note that an RDBMS is not the best database design for all types of data. Even in more recent writings by the father of the RDBMS, Codd [5] admits that a “relational database is best suited to data with a rather regular or homogeneous structure” and that more research is needed to determine if an RDBMS can sufficiently handle “heterogeneous data” such as “images, text, and miscellaneous facts.”
	- The ==associative database model== is claimed to offer advantages over RDBMS and other database models. While an RDBMS and other database models are record-based – with data stored in rows and columns in tabular representations shown in figures 4 and 5 – all data in the associative database model is modeled as discrete independent data elements.
	- Relationships between data elements are modeled as **associations**. Griffiths [7] describes these *“two fundamental data structures” as “„**Items**‟ and a set of „**Links**‟ that connect them together.”* Williams [17] introduces the associative database model as having two types of data structures, Items which have *“a unique identifier, a name and a type”* and Links which have *“a unique identifier, together with the unique identifiers of three other things, that represent the source, verb and target of a fact that is recorded about the source in the database.”* He further notes that *“each of the three things identified by the source, verb and target may each be either a link or an item.”*

	- ADBMS that may make it more attractive to future users is its inherent security features. The content (data) and index (associations) can be stored together or separately in different places. If a hacker were to access one or the other, Aysola [1] notes that “nothing more than an unlimited character string” is revealed.

	- Brains do not need new thought
	  processes to think about new things —
	  why do computers? Every new relational
	  application needs a new set of programs
	  developed from scratch, because a
	  program written to use one set of tables
	  cannot be reused with a different set.
	  This creates a need for a never-ending
	  supply of new programs, the
	  development and maintenance of which
	  is labour-intensive, expensive and
	  wasteful
	- Users do not all need the same
	  functions — why is customisation so
	  difficult? Relational applications offered
	  by ASPs (Application Service Providers)
	  and package vendors can only be tailored
	  to the needs of large numbers of
	  individual users through complex
	  parameterisation or through customisation
	  which renders subsequent upgrades more
	  difficult. Finding a way to support the
	  customisation of applications for
	  individual users is one of the main challenges faced by early players in the
	  burgeoning ASP marketplace.
	- All customers are not the same —
	  why store the same information about
	  each one? Relational applications cannot
	  record a piece of information about an
	  individual thing that is not relevant to
	  every other thing of the same type.
	  Consequently, applications have to store
	  the same information about every
	  customer, order, product and so on. This
	  limits marketers’ ability to continually
	  improve the quality of customer service,
	  because applications cannot record and
	  take account of the needs of individual
	  customers.
	- All databases store data — why can
	  they not work together more easily?
	  Information about identical things in the
	  real world is structured differently in
	  every relational database, so it is difficult
	  and expensive to amalgamate two
	  databases. The cost of integrating systems
	  is now a major impediment to mergers
	  and acquisitions. Extracting useful
	  information from across several databases
	  demands expensive data warehousing and
	  mining projects.
	- It is no longer necessary to write every
	  new application from scratch. The same
	  set of programs can be used to
	  implement many different associative
	  applications without being altered or
	  rewritten in any way, allowing users to
	  create new applications from existing
	  ones. The saving in software
	  development costs afforded by this
	  capability will be substantial.
	  Applications can be tailored for
	  individual users. Associative applications
	  can permit features to be used or ignored
	  selectively by individual users without
	  the need for parameterisation or customisation. Data sets can be similarly
	  partitioned with precise granularity, to be
	  visible or invisible to individual users.
	  This approach is ideally suited to the
	  needs of ASPs and application package
	  vendors alike.
	  The information needed about each
	  customer can be stored precisely. An
	  associative database can record
	  information that is relevant only to one
	  thing of a particular type, without
	  demanding that it be relevant to all other
	  things of the same type. With this
	  capability, we can continue to enhance
	  the quality of customer service and hone
	  competitive edge.
	  Databases can be integrated without
	  extra programming or data warehousing
	  tools. Separate associative databases can
	  be readily correlated or merged without
	  extra programming, and multiple
	  databases distributed across many servers
	  can be accessed by applications as though
	  they were a single database. These
	  capabilities significantly reduce the cost
	  of amalgamating databases, and allow
	  information to be readily extracted from
	  across multiple databases without the
	  need for data warehousing.
	- Many people who hear the term
	  ‘relational’ for the first time assume that it
	  derives from relationships between the
	  things stored in the database. In fact, it
	  comes from the mathematical concept of
	  a ‘relation’: ‘Given sets S1, S2, . . ., Sn, R
	  is a relation on these n sets if it is a set of
	  n-tuples, the first component of which is
	  drawn from S1, the second component
	  from S2, and so on’. The proper term for
	  the tables described here is ‘relations’.

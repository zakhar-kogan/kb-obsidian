	- Two of the relatively well-known database models are the hierarchical and network models. Hierarchical models involve “a data structure in which the elements of the structure have only one-to-many relationships with one another”

	- One of the most commonly used database structures is the relational database model. As the name implies the relational database model “has the relation at its heart, but then a whole series of rules governing keys, relationships, joins, functional dependencies, transitive dependencies, multi-valued dependencies, and modification anomalies” [14 The Relational Data Model, para. 1].

	- Two of the relatively well-known database models are the ==hierarchical and network models.== Hierarchical models involve “a data structure in which the elements of the structure have only one-to-many relationships with one another”

	- Similarly, Kroenke [11] defines a network database structure is one “in which at least one of the
	  relationships is many-to-many.”

	- One of the most commonly used database structures is the ==relational database model==. As the name implies the relational database model “has the relation at its heart, but then a whole series of rules governing keys, relationships, joins, functional dependencies, transitive dependencies, multi-valued dependencies, and modification anomalies” [14 The Relational Data Model, para. 1].

	- Normalization is a major challenge in RDBMS design. Kroenke [10] defines normalization as “a
	  process for converting a relation that has certain problems to two or more relations that do not have these problems.” Much is written about tips for normalizing a database and many authors note that an RDBMS is not the best database design for all types of data. Even in more recent writings by the father of the RDBMS, Codd [5] admits that a “relational database is best suited to data with a rather regular or homogeneous structure” and that more research is needed to determine if an RDBMS can sufficiently handle “heterogeneous data” such as “images, text, and miscellaneous facts.”
	- The ==associative database model== is claimed to offer advantages over RDBMS and other database models. While an RDBMS and other database models are record-based – with data stored in rows and columns in tabular representations shown in figures 4 and 5 – all data in the associative database model is modeled as discrete independent data elements.
	- Relationships between data elements are modeled as **associations**. Griffiths [7] describes these *“two fundamental data structures” as “„**Items**‟ and a set of „**Links**‟ that connect them together.”* Williams [17] introduces the associative database model as having two types of data structures, Items which have *“a unique identifier, a name and a type”* and Links which have *“a unique identifier, together with the unique identifiers of three other things, that represent the source, verb and target of a fact that is recorded about the source in the database.”* He further notes that *“each of the three things identified by the source, verb and target may each be either a link or an item.”*

	- ADBMS that may make it more attractive to future users is its inherent security features. The content (data) and index (associations) can be stored together or separately in different places. If a hacker were to access one or the other, Aysola [1] notes that “nothing more than an unlimited character string” is revealed.

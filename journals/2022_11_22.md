- [[tokenomics]] [[token engineering]] Module 3: Design Phase
	- In the **Discovery Phase**, we identified business requirements and the structure of our system. In the ==Design Phase== we *translate this information into precise mathematical variables*, so we analyze objectives and system optimization in a precise way.
	- The goal here is to find a mathematical **state space** representation of the system, which encodes all quantities in variables. These variables give a total description of the system at any moment in time.
	- ### Constant sum AMM
	  collapsed:: true
		- **The total number of coins in the pool is constant. Additionally, you express this in a simple way: ***x + y = constant.*** **
		- **Now, everyone knows exactly how to make their trades, without changing the conditions of the pool.**

		- In this case, $Token X = Aurium$ and $Token Y = Goldium$. The constant value is 10 for this graph; however, the constant value would depend on the initial amount of each Token.
		- Starting at 0 $Aurium$, you would have the full amount of $Goldiu$m, and vice versa. An increase of either of the two tokens will cause a decrease in the other quantity.
		- You realize you need to address the liquidity and demand issues;  that there is a fundamental problem with your rule, especially in the green circles (on the graph) when liquidity of one of the coins is almost empty. It's possible for the constant-sum system to run out of one type of coin, which makes large trades impossible if demand for one coin grows too large.

		- You realize something about the *curve* that you have drawn, the slope can be used to determine the price of the tokens. This is done by setting the *price* equal to the opposite of the *slope* of the curve.
		- What would we do if the demand for the coins changed, so that one Goldium and one Aurium were no longer equivalent? We could switch to a ***weighted constant sum market maker, ***of the form*** ax + by = constant.***
	- ### Variable Definitions and Prices
		- To implement our system, we need to have a *mathematical description* that reflects the *goals* and *requirements*.
		- In moving to a mathematical model, each variable corresponds to a measurable quantity in the real world. The variables we use should be represented by the stocks in our stock-and-flow diagrams. 
		  We need to keep track of things like
			- the amount of each token **in the pool**
			- the amount of each token **in each trader's wallet**
		- #### Variable examples
			- We can use
				- *x *to represent the amount of Token X in the pool
				- *y* to represent the amount of Token Y in the pool
			- We need to track the same things for our trader, so let’s use
				- $A_x$ for the amount of Token X the trader has in their wallet
				- $A_y$ for the amount of Token Y the trader has in their wallet
			- Let's use
				- SP, for the total shares in the pool
				- SA, for the total shares held by the agent.

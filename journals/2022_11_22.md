	- In the **Discovery Phase**, we identified business requirements and the structure of our system. In the ==Design Phase== we *translate this information into precise mathematical variables*, so we analyze objectives and system optimization in a precise way.
	- The goal here is to find a mathematical **state space** representation of the system, which encodes all quantities in variables. These variables give a total description of the system at any moment in time.

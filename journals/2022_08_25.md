- [[Lithium]]
	- The top four players, SQM, Albemarle, Ganfeng and Tianqi will continue to dominate [[Lithium]] supply for a few more years. The number five & six players in vertically integrated [[Lithium]] chemicals [[production]], Livent and Allkem, together equal less than half of the chemical [[production]] of the smallest “Big 4” player. Hopefully that changes soon.
	- Now that annual demand is growing at > 200K MT of LCE per year, it is easy to see why the “Big 4” needs to morph into the “Big 8” or more very soon. Spoiler alert: a “Big 8” is highly unlikely before 2030. Developing [[Lithium]] projects is much more time intensive than building battery capacity.

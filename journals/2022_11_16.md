	- The most distinctive output for a graph query is another graph, which is ordinarily a transformation, a selection or a projection of the original graph stored in the database. This implies that graph visualization is strongly tied to the graph querying
	- Developing heuristics for some hard graph problems: For example, partitioning of large-scale dynamic graph data for efficient distributed processing belongs among these problems, given that the classical graph partitioning problem is NP-hard.
	- Graph pattern matching: New semantics and algorithms for graph pattern matching over distributed graphs are in development, given that the classical subgraph isomorphism problem is NP-complete.

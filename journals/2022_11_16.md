	- The most distinctive output for a graph query is another graph, which is ordinarily a transformation, a selection or a projection of the original graph stored in the database. This implies that graph visualization is strongly tied to the graph querying
	- Developing heuristics for some hard graph problems: For example, partitioning of large-scale dynamic graph data for efficient distributed processing belongs among these problems, given that the classical graph partitioning problem is NP-hard.
	- Graph pattern matching: New semantics and algorithms for graph pattern matching over distributed graphs are in development, given that the classical subgraph isomorphism problem is NP-complete.

	- We have contributed to this goal with two mathematical concepts which allow us to remove different forms of redundancy in networks: 1) *distance closures*, and 2) [canalization via schema re-description](https://casci.binghamton.edu/projects/control-automata/). The first concept allows us to infer the invariant subgraph that is sufficient to compute all shortest paths in a weighted graph: the *distance backbone*. This has demonstrated that there is massive redundancy in many networks in different domains, whereby most edges in a network are not necessary to compute shortest paths (e.g. 90% of edges in some brain networks). Removing redundant edges can facilitate computation and discovery of important pathways in many applications. The removal of this redundancy simplifies and indeed enables the characterization of information transmission and dynamics on large biochemical, brain, social, technological, and knowledge (including for automatic fact-checking) networks, which are otherwise too large to study analytically [[Correia et al, 2022](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.02.482557v2); [Correia, Barrat, and Rocha, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.02.02.478784); [Simas, Correia, and Rocha, 2022](https://doi.org/10.1093/comnet/cnab021); [Teixeira et al, 2020](https://casci.binghamton.edu/publications/ps/BrainBackbonesComplexNetworks20.pdf); [Simas and Rocha, 2015](https://casci.binghamton.edu/publications/NWS14.php); [Ciampaglia et al, 2015](https://casci.binghamton.edu/publications/PLOSONE15B.php); [Simas and Rocha, 2012](https://casci.binghamton.edu/publications/WI2012.html); [Rocha, 2002](https://casci.binghamton.edu/publications/semimetricIOS.html)] .
	- For instance, documents in the WWW are related via a hyperlink network, while documents in bibliographic databases are related by citation and collaboration networks. Furthermore, documents can be related to semantic tags such as keywords used to describe their content. Given these relations, we can compute distance functions (typically via co-occurrence measures) amongst documents and/or semantic tags, thus creating associative, weighted networks between these items—which denote stronger or weaker co-associations. We have used such distance and proximity networks for inference and discovery of protein-protein and drug-drug interactions, health and comorbidity risks, gender and age biases, automatic fact-checking, pharmacokinetic parameters in drug interaction and adverse reaction studies, protein sequence and structure prediction, functional annotation of transcription data, enzyme annotation publications, etc (see publications listed below). We have also used distance and proximity graphs to uncover modules or clusters in the network that may be associated with a particular topic or community of interest. We have applied clustering methods to biomedical, social, knowledge, scientific co-authorship and citation networks (see our [bibliome informatics](https://casci.binghamton.edu/projects/biomedical-text-mining/) and [adaptive web](https://casci.binghamton.edu/projects/knowledge-networks/) projects for more details),etc. We have also used information-theoretical approaches to classify documents of interest in probabilistic graphs of citation co-occurrence in scientific citation networks [[Kolchinsky et al, 2010]](https://casci.binghamton.edu/publications/TCBB10.html).

	- This is, in effect, a definition of agency directly related to the one put forward in the XIII century by Thomas Aquinas: an entity capable of election, or choice.
	- This is a very important definition indeed; for an entity to be referred to as an agent, it must be able to step out of the dynamics of an environment, and make a decision about what action to take next---a decision that may even go against the natural course of its environment. By this, simplistically, we mean that an agent (say in a steep incline) can opt to go uphill rather than roll with the force of gravity. Since choice is a term loaded with many connotations from theology, philosophy, cognitive science, and so forth, we prefer to discuss instead the ability of some agents to step out of the dynamics of its interaction with an environment and explore different behavior alternatives. In physics we refer to such a process as [dynamical incoherence](https://casci.binghamton.edu/publications/caalife04.html). In computer science, Von Neumann, based on the work of Turing on universal computing devices, referred to these systems as ==memory-based systems==. That is, systems capable of engaging with their environments beyond concurrent state-determined interaction by using memory to store descriptions and representations of their environments. Such agents are dynamically incoherent in the sense that their next state or action is not solely dependent on the previous state, but also on some (random-access) stable memory that keeps the same value until it is accessed and does not change with the dynamics of the environment-agent interaction. In contrast, state-determined systems are dynamically coherent (or coupled) to their environments because they function by reaction to present input and state using some iterative mapping in a state space.
	- The strong sense of agency has been further detailed in an [overview of agent models](https://casci.binghamton.edu/publications/sim/review.html) for a previous project of the [modeling of socio-technical systems](http://wwwc3.lanl.gov/~joslyn/nmsu/) as well as in an overview of [research on complex systems modeling](https://casci.binghamton.edu/publications/complex/csm.html). Examples of agent-based models we have worked on are: the [simulations of evolving agents with different kinds of reproduction strategies](https://casci.binghamton.edu/projects/biosemiotics) using [Fuzzy Development Programs](https://casci.binghamton.edu/publications/FDP/index.html), the [agent-based model of genotype editing](https://casci.binghamton.edu/publications/editing/) ([summarized below](https://casci.binghamton.edu/projects/agent-based-modeling/index.php#RNA)), the [evolving cellular automata and emergent computation experiments](https://casci.binghamton.edu/projects/control-automata/index.php#EVCA), the [soft computing agents for recommendation systems (especially TalkMine)](https://casci.binghamton.edu/projects/knowledge-networks/), the [immune-inspired spam detection algorithm](https://casci.binghamton.edu/projects/agent-based-modeling/index.php#ais), etc.

	- The Collective Choice Model of Richards, McKay, and Richards [1998]. This model aims at the investigation of a fundamental problem of social choice models, particularly those used to model collective choice of political alternatives. Previously, it has been showed [e.g. Arrow, 1963, McKelvey, 1979] that the aggregation of elements into a collective choice when many agents and possible choices are involved typically leads to unstable, cyclic outcomes - for instance when we implement majority vote rules on automata. This is clearly at odds with reality where societies are capable of reaching stable political outcomes even in political systems with many available choices. The authors claim that such cyclic behavior exists because the previous system used to study collective choice do not make use of appropriate common structure among agents (this claim is in line with the models of the previous section). Indeed, agents in previous models are assumed to make their own choices autonomously. The authors show mathematically and computationally that by establishing a shared knowledge structure, the probability of such cyclic behavior is reduced dramatically (figure below).

	- The shared knowledge structure is implemented as a graph structure among alternatives. Such a graph implements the regularities of a particular choice landscape or environment. It is very reasonable to assume that alternatives are not all equally related (or un-related), but possess some structure. For instance, when deciding what kind of movie we want to watch, we all share some common knowledge: we know that a horror movie is more related to a violent action movie than to a romantic comedy. Likewise, we know that a Christian-democrat party is more related to a social democrat than to a communist party.
	- The shared knowledge structure implemented as a graph effectively establishes constraints on the choices which implement the regularities of a given choice system.
	- From the shared knowledge structure, different partial orders can be established to represent agents with different dispositions towards the shared knowledge structure. For instance, agents who prefer romantic comedies to horror movies, etc. See figure below.

	- Therefore, the setup of environments for multi-agent simulations needs to:
		- Specify the dynamics of self-organization: specify laws and their initial conditions, which are responsible for the characteristics of the artificial environment (including agents) and the emergence of context-specific rules.
			- Example: In Lindgren's [1991] experiments described in section 3.1.1, the laws of the system are the conditions specified in the iterated prisoner's dilemma and the genetic algorithm - these are inexorable in this simulation. The context-specific rules are the several strategies that emerge whose success depends on the other strategies which co-exist in the environment and therefore also specify its demands together with the laws. However, the same laws can lead to different transitory rules, and thus, different agent environments.
		- Observe emergent or specify constructed semantics: identify emergent or pre-programmed, but changeable, rules that generate agent behavior in tandem with environmental laws. In particular, we are interested in the behavior of agents that can simulate semantics and decision processes.
			- Example: The experiments of Hutchins and Hazlehurst described in section 3.3 clearly separate between the laws of the agents' environment (the regularity of tide and moon states) and the artifacts used by the agents to communicate the semantics of these regularities among themselves. The semantics of the artifacts emerges in these simulations.
		- Provide a pragmatic selection criteria: create or identify a mechanism of selection so that the semantics identified in *ii* is grounded in a given environment. This selection criteria is based on constraints imposed both by the inexorable laws of the environment and the emergent rules. When based only on the first, we model an unchanging set of environmental demands (explicit selection), while when we include the second, we model a changing set of environmental demands instead (implicit selection).
			- Example. Typically the selection criteria is implemented by an evolutionary (genetic or cultural) algorithm with implicit or explicit evaluation function. The explicit function is seen in Hinton and Nowlan experiments, while the implicit function is seen in Ackley and Littman's experiments, both in section 3.2.

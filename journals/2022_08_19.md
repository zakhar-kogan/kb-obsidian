	- [[Game theory]], normal game
	  collapsed:: true
		- Players: **who** is involved?
		- Rules: **what** can the players do?
		- Outcomes: what will **happen** when players perform a certain **action**?
		- Preferences: what **players want the most** of the possible outcomes?
	- The [[design]] of institutions (Rules) can have a profound [[impact]] on the results (Outcomes) of interactions, [[System]]'s functioning.
	  collapsed:: true
		- Example: an auction with closed/sealed bids vs. open outcry can have an [[impact]] on what the bidders [[learn]] about other bidders' intentions.
	- Mechanism design vs economic theory
	  collapsed:: true
		- Economic theory
		  collapsed:: true
			- Tries to understand economic institutions
			- Explains outcomes that institutions generate
			- Positive, predictive
		- Mechanism design
		  collapsed:: true
			- Begins by identifying desired outcomes (goals)
			- Asks whether institutions (mechanisms) can be designed to achieve goals
			- If so, what forms would institutions take?
			- Normative, prescriptive
		- Simple example
		  collapsed:: true
			- Dividing a pie between two kids
			- How to achieve fair division?
			  collapsed:: true
				- Mother divides equally
				- Kids can see the cake differently
				- Age-old solution (Lot & Abraham => grazing land)
					- Actor [[1]] chooses how to divide => will divide equal in his eyes
					- Actor [[2]] chooses which piece to take => will choose the most suitable in his eyes

	- Glossary
		- Monotonicity
		  collapsed:: true
			- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monotonicity_(mechanism_design)
			- If the [[social]] choice changes when a single player changes his valuation, then it must be because the player increased his value of the new choice relative to his value of the old choice.
	- Theorems
	  collapsed:: true
		- If a [[social]] rule is implementable, then it must be monotonic. Maskin, 1977
		- Suppose there are at least three individuals. If the [[social]] choice rule satisfies monotonicity and no veto power, then it is implementable.
	- Main takeaways
	  collapsed:: true
		- Mechanism designer doesn't know optimal outcomes in advance
		- So she must proceed indirectly through a mechanism
		  collapsed:: true
			- so the participants themselves generate information needed to identify optimal outcome
		- But participants don't care about the designer's goals, they only care about their objectives
		  collapsed:: true
			- so mechanism must be [[incentive]] compatible

	- Computer science in MD
		- Deals with distributed settings are researched in CS in conjunction to MD
		- Those are about several computers performing computations to achieve a common outcome according to some algorithm
		- It is **assumed** the participants follow the protocol, however this is obviously not the case

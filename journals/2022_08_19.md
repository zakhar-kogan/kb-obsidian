	- [[Game theory]], normal game
		- Players: **who** is involved?
		- Rules: **what** can the players do?
		- Outcomes: what will **happen** when players perform a certain **action**?
		- Preferences: what **players want the most** of the possible outcomes?
	- The [[design]] of institutions (Rules) can have a profound [[impact]] on the results (Outcomes) of interactions, [[System]]'s functioning.
		- Example: an auction with closed/sealed bids vs. open outcry can have an [[impact]] on what the bidders [[learn]] about other bidders' intentions.
	- Mechanism design vs economic theory
		- Economic theory
			- Tries to understand economic institutions
			- Explains outcomes that institutions generate
			- Positive, predictive
		- Mechanism design
		  collapsed:: true
			- Begins by identifying desired outcomes (goals)
			- Asks whether institutions (mechanisms) can be designed to achieve goals
			- If so, what forms would institutions take?
			- Normative, prescriptive
		- Main takeaways
			- Mechanism designer doesn't know optimal outcomes in advance
			- So she must proceed indirectly through a mechanism
				- so the participants themselves generate information needed to identify optimal outcome
			- But participants don't care about the designer's goals, they only care about their objectives
				- so mechanism must be [[incentive]] compatible
		- Simple example
		  collapsed:: true
			- Dividing a pie between two kids
			- How to achieve fair division?
			  collapsed:: true
				- Mother divides equally
				- Kids can see the cake differently
				- Age-old solution (Lot & Abraham => grazing land)
					- Actor [[1]] chooses how to divide => will divide equal in his eyes
					- Actor [[2]] chooses which piece to take => will choose the most suitable in his eyes

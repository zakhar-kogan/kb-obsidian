	- The first step in the token engineering process is the discovery phase.
	- Seven steps for translating the client's vision into a workable form:
		- Defining the System Goals
			- Each system has a **design objective**, a *raison d’etre* that drives its creation. All subsequent phases of our work will be focused on achieving this objective, so we need to be very sure that we know what we are aiming for.
			- After we have identified the overall objective, we can then define specific system goals. These goals help make our objective more concrete and measurable. Often, there will be several different system goals, some of which are in tension with each other, and we will not be able to optimize all of these goals simultaneously.
			- It helps to locate these goals in various categories (like e.g. technical, economic, etc.) to understand the trade-offs between them. Doing so will lead to recommendations and guide decision makers through the process. Discussing the system at these levels also allow us to look for parallels that exist in other projects or domains, allowing us to borrow these ideas for our projects.
			- Before we can build the technical parts of the system, we need to have a clear mental model of how the component parts interact.
			- Determining the ==**design objective**== for a system is a crucial first step. In the context of cryptoeconomic systems, the objective is to build an infrastructure for economic interactions between agents so that the system will achieve the objectives of all participants over the system’s full life cycle.
			- Generally speaking this objective has to guide the project in the right direction and make it aligned with the system’s mission or purpose.
			- After defining the overall objective, we define **==system goals==**.
			- Typically, the system goals are more concrete than the overall objective, which can be somewhat abstract. Often, there will be several different system goals, and it may not be possible to simultaneously fulfill them all.

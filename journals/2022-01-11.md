[Acute tianeptine treatment selectively modulates neuronal activation in the central nucleus of the amygdala and attenuates fear extinction | Molecular Psychiatry (nature.com)](https://www.nature.com/articles/mp2014169)

Chronic treatment with the antidepressant tianeptine has been shown to reduce the acquisition of extinction [[learning]] in rats, yet the drug’s acute influence on activation in [[prefrontal]] and amygdalar regions, and on extinction learning are not well understood. To assess its influence on cellular activation, rats were injected with [[tianeptine]] and Fos immunoreactivity was measured in these regions. Acute tianeptine treatment selectively altered Fos expression within subdivisions of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CEA) in a bidirectional manner that varied in relation to ongoing activation within the capsular subdivision and its prefrontal and intra-amygdalar inputs.

[[Tianeptine]] does not bind to α- or β-adrenergic, dopamine, SE, GABA, glutamate, benzodiazepine, muscarinic, or histamine receptors, nor does it affect calcium channels or the neuronal transport protein for NE or dopamine.11,12 Chronic administration of tianeptine also does not alter the density or the affinity of α2, β1, SE-1, SE-2, or [[GABA]] receptors or imipramine or benzodiazepine binding sites.11

Tianeptine in vivo, after both acute and repeated treatment, enhances SE uptake in the cortex and hippocampus but not in the mesencephalon and has no direct effect on NE or DA uptake.13 These findings were confirmed in a study in which tianeptine increased but sertraline decreased the concentration of 5-HIAA, the major metabolite of SE formed by oxidation mediated by [[monoamine]] oxidase (MAO)-A, particularly in the hippocampus and hypothalamus.14,15

Short-term treatment with tianeptine also increases NE levels in the preoptic area, the parietal sensory cortex, and dorsal raphe and decreases NE turnover in the parietal sensory cortex, dorsal raphe, and parietal motor cortex, indicating that tianeptine can also alter the central NE system, perhaps indirectly through its action on the SE system.16 In addition, short-term tianeptine treatment increased extracellular DA concentration in the nucleus accumbens and, at higher doses, in the frontal cortex but not in the striatum, and the effect on DA was not diminished by marked depletion of SE by intracerebroventricular administration of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine, suggesting this effect is not dependent on a central SE mechanism.17,18

Sustained treatment with tianeptine did not modify the firing of SE neurons in the dorsal raphe or their responsiveness to intravenous injections of lysergic acid diethylamide ([[LSD]]) or 8-OH-DPAT, which are agonists at the somatodendritic SE autoreceptor.22 The firing of hippocampal CA3 pyramidal neurons in response to microiontophoretic application of SE also remained unchanged. However, chronic administration (14 days) of tianeptine did reduce the expression of the SE transporter mRNA and the number of SE transporter binding sites.

Tianeptine has a number of effects on [[stress]] responses. Specifically, it reverses stress-induced deficits in exploratory activity31 and attenuates the behavioral signs of sickness behavior in rats induced by the cytokine inducer [[lipopolysaccharide]] (LPS) and the prototypical proinflammatory [[cytokine]], interleukin (IL)-1β.32 Tianeptine shares with several tricyclic antidepressants and [[fluoxetine]] the ability to inhibit corticosterone-induced gene transcription.33 Tianeptine prevents atrophy of apical dendrites in the CA3 region of the hippocampus caused by chronic daily restraint stress or by daily administration of corticosterone.34-36

Tianeptine is converted by hamster, mouse, and rat [[CYP]] enzymes into a reactive metabolite. 41 That finding has been extended to human liver microsomes and involves glucocorticoid inducible CYP enzymes, possibly CYP 3A but not CYP 2D6 or CYP 1A2.

When subjects received [[tianeptine]] under [[fasting]] conditions the lag time before absorption onset, and the time of the maximum [[plasma concentration]] were 0.55 +/- 0.26 hours and 1.29 +/- 0.29 hours, respectively. The maximum plasma concentration was 322 +/- 44 ng/mL, and the total area under the curve 994 +/- 248 ng/hr/mL. When tianeptine was given at the end of the meal, several significant changes were found for tianeptine kinetic parameters; the lag time increased by 0.3 hour and the maximum plasma concentration was lowered (decreased by 25%) and occurred later (tmax increased by 0.5 hour). However, no significant change was found in the area under the plasma concentration-time curve.

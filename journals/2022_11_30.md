		- **Governance** is the process of interactions through the [laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law), [norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm), [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(social_and_political)) or [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language) of an organized society[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance#cite_note-1) over a [social system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_system) ([family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family), [tribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe), [formal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_organization) or [informal organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_organization), a [territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory) or across territories). It is done by the [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government) of a [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity)), by a [market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics)), or by a [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network). It is the [decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making) among the actors involved in a collective problem that leads to the creation, reinforcement, or reproduction of [social norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm) and [institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution)".[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance#cite_note-Hufty_2011-2) In lay terms, it could be described as the political processes that exist in and between formal institutions.
		- Governance is the way rules, norms and actions are structured, sustained,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance#cite_note-3) regulated and held [accountable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability).[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] The degree of formality depends on the internal rules of a given [organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization) and, externally, with its [business partners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_partner). As such, governance may take many forms, driven by many different motivations and with many different results. For instance, a government may operate as a [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy) where citizens vote on who should govern and the [public good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)) is the goal, while a [non-profit organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-profit_organization) or a [corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation) may be governed by a small [board of directors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors) and pursue more specific aims.

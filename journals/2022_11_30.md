		- **Governance** is the process of interactions through the [laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law), [norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm), [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(social_and_political)) or [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language) of an organized society[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance#cite_note-1) over a [social system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_system) ([family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family), [tribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe), [formal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_organization) or [informal organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_organization), a [territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory) or across territories). It is done by the [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government) of a [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity)), by a [market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics)), or by a [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network). It is the [decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making) among the actors involved in a collective problem that leads to the creation, reinforcement, or reproduction of [social norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm) and [institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution)".[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance#cite_note-Hufty_2011-2) In lay terms, it could be described as the political processes that exist in and between formal institutions.
		- Governance is the way rules, norms and actions are structured, sustained,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance#cite_note-3) regulated and held [accountable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability).[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] The degree of formality depends on the internal rules of a given [organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization) and, externally, with its [business partners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_partner). As such, governance may take many forms, driven by many different motivations and with many different results. For instance, a government may operate as a [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy) where citizens vote on who should govern and the [public good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)) is the goal, while a [non-profit organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-profit_organization) or a [corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation) may be governed by a small [board of directors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors) and pursue more specific aims.

		- Investors, Builders, and Early Adopters of web-based cryptographically secured social and economic infrastructure and applications have a wide range of beliefs and values but some key concepts form a common thread: privacy, transparency and agency.
		- [At first blush, privacy and transparency are in direct tension](https://forum.1hive.org/t/music-video-is-privacy-in-defiance-of-internet-metaphysics/2329), but this provides a fertile ground for discussing trade-offs. Agency then includes the right of humans to opt-in and out of web3 networks. Furthermore, opting-in does not require an intermediary, provided you are sufficiently technically inclined to manage your own infrastructure and/or private keys.
		- Another interesting tension arises in the pursuit of agency: in a network, participants are connected, so often one’s right to control their own actions can negatively impact others. At one level, protocols can be said to address this directly by providing an explicit specification of what actions are and are not acceptable within the network. However, at the level of governing these networks the boundaries of these rights are non-obvious.

		- Blockchain networks and similar distributed ledgers can disrupt traditional governance structures and challenge the current forms of how society organizes itself. They can (i) reduce the principal-agent dilemma of organizations by providing transparency; (ii) incentivize network actors with a native token, thereby disintermediating and reducing management costs, and (iii) replace the reactive procedural security of the current legal system, with proactive and automated mechanisms that make a potential breach of contract expensive, and therefore infeasible. Web3 networks generally provide more decentralized and spontaneous coordination over the Internet between people and institutions who might not even know or trust each other. The coordination structures are referred to as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).

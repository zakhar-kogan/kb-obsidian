		- **Governance** is the process of interactions through the [laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law), [norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm), [power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_(social_and_political)) or [language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language) of an organized society[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance#cite_note-1) over a [social system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_system) ([family](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family), [tribe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribe), [formal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_organization) or [informal organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Informal_organization), a [territory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territory) or across territories). It is done by the [government](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Government) of a [state](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_(polity)), by a [market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_(economics)), or by a [network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network). It is the [decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision-making) among the actors involved in a collective problem that leads to the creation, reinforcement, or reproduction of [social norms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_norm) and [institutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institution)".[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance#cite_note-Hufty_2011-2) In lay terms, it could be described as the political processes that exist in and between formal institutions.
		- Governance is the way rules, norms and actions are structured, sustained,[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Governance#cite_note-3) regulated and held [accountable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accountability).[*[citation needed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed)*] The degree of formality depends on the internal rules of a given [organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization) and, externally, with its [business partners](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_partner). As such, governance may take many forms, driven by many different motivations and with many different results. For instance, a government may operate as a [democracy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democracy) where citizens vote on who should govern and the [public good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_good_(economics)) is the goal, while a [non-profit organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-profit_organization) or a [corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporation) may be governed by a small [board of directors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_directors) and pursue more specific aims.

		- Investors, Builders, and Early Adopters of web-based cryptographically secured social and economic infrastructure and applications have a wide range of beliefs and values but some key concepts form a common thread: privacy, transparency and agency.
		- [At first blush, privacy and transparency are in direct tension](https://forum.1hive.org/t/music-video-is-privacy-in-defiance-of-internet-metaphysics/2329), but this provides a fertile ground for discussing trade-offs. Agency then includes the right of humans to opt-in and out of web3 networks. Furthermore, opting-in does not require an intermediary, provided you are sufficiently technically inclined to manage your own infrastructure and/or private keys.
		- Another interesting tension arises in the pursuit of agency: in a network, participants are connected, so often one’s right to control their own actions can negatively impact others. At one level, protocols can be said to address this directly by providing an explicit specification of what actions are and are not acceptable within the network. However, at the level of governing these networks the boundaries of these rights are non-obvious.

		- [[blockchain]] networks and similar distributed ledgers can disrupt traditional governance structures and challenge the current forms of how society organizes itself. They can (i) reduce the principal-agent dilemma of organizations by providing transparency; (ii) incentivize network actors with a native token, thereby disintermediating and reducing management costs, and (iii) replace the reactive procedural security of the current legal system, with proactive and automated mechanisms that make a potential breach of contract expensive, and therefore infeasible. Web3 networks generally provide more decentralized and spontaneous coordination over the Internet between people and institutions who might not even know or trust each other. The coordination structures are referred to as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs).

	  collapsed:: true
		- Social scalability is the ability of an institution -- a relationship or shared endeavor, in which multiple people repeatedly participate -- to overcome shortcomings in human minds and in the motivating or constraining aspects of said institution that limit who or how many can successfully participate.
		- The social scalability of an institutional technology depends on how that technology constrains or motivates participation in that institution, including protection of participants and the institution itself from harmful participation or attack.
		- **Trust minimization is reducing the vulnerability of participants to each other's and to outsiders' and intermediaries' potential for harmful behavior.**
		- **The main social scalability benefit of blockchains is trust minimization**
		- A [[blockchain]] can reduce vulnerability by locking in the integrity of some important performances (such as the creation and payment of money) and some important information flows.
		- Trust in the secret and arbitrarily mutable activities of a private computation can be replaced by verifiable confidence in the behavior of a generally immutable public computation.
		- Security via root-trusting access control, designed for small and chummy offices like Bell Labs, breaks down as an efficient and effective security mechanism as organizations become larger
		- The more strangers one receives emails from, the more likely one is likely to get a phishing attack or a malware-laced attachment
		- With current web services, we are fully trusting to the computer, or more specifically the people who have access to that computer, to faithfully execute our orders
		- Bitcoin's automated integrity comes at high costs in its performance and resource usage
		- Money requires social [[scalability]] in its design, via security
		- The "chains" of a blockchain should be Merkle trees or other cryptographic structures with a similar integrity functionality of post-unforgeable integrity, and transactions should be replicated in a way that is objectively tolerant to worst-case malicious problems and actors to a high degree.
	- https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social-choice-theory.asp
	  collapsed:: true
		- ** [[Social choice theory]] ** is an economic theory that considers whether a society can be ordered in a way that reflects individual preferences. The theory was developed by economist [Kenneth Arrow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/k/kenneth-arrow.asp) and published in his book* Social Choice and Individual Values* in 1951.1
		- Social choice theory is concerned with **finding an optimal method that aggregates individual preferences, judgments, votes, and decisions for good rule**.
		- Kenneth Arrow is generally credited for social choice theory but the groundwork was laid by Nicolas de Condorcet in the 18th century.
		- Arrow's book specifies **five conditions that a society's choices must meet to reflect individual choices.**
			- **Universality**: The decision rule must yield a complete ranking of all preferences and do so consistently under identical conditions.
			- **Responsiveness**: An increase in an individual preference for an alternative must also either increase or at least not change, but never decrease, the overall social preference for that alternative.
			- **Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives**: The inclusion or exclusion of certain alternatives must not alter the rank order of other alternatives with respect to one another.
			- **Non-imposition**: The set of aggregated social preferences must be a product of one or more combinations of individual preferences.
			- **Non-dictatorship: **The rule must actually reflect the preferences of multiple parties, and not simply of a single individual.

	- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem
	  collapsed:: true
		- **Arrow's impossibility theorem**, the **general possibility theorem** or **Arrow's paradox** is an [impossibility theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_impossibility) in [social choice theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_choice_theory) that states that when voters have three or more distinct alternatives (options), no [ranked voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranked_voting) [electoral system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_system) can convert the **ranked preferences** of individuals into a community-wide (complete and transitive) ranking while also meeting the specified set of criteria: *[unrestricted domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unrestricted_domain)*, *[non-dictatorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-dictatorship)*, *[Pareto efficiency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_efficiency)*, and *[independence of irrelevant alternatives](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_of_irrelevant_alternatives)*. The theorem is often cited in discussions of voting theory as it is further interpreted by the [Gibbard–Satterthwaite theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gibbard%E2%80%93Satterthwaite_theorem).
		- In short, the theorem states that no rank-order electoral system can be designed that always satisfies these three "fairness" criteria:
			- If every voter prefers alternative X over alternative Y, then the group prefers X over Y.
			- If every voter's preference between X and Y remains unchanged, then the group's preference between X and Y will also remain unchanged (even if voters' preferences between other pairs like X and Z, Y and Z, or Z and W change).
			- There is no "dictator": no single voter possesses the power to always determine the group's preference.

		- In [mathematical folklore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_folklore), the "**no free lunch**" (**NFL**) **theorem** (sometimes pluralized) of [David Wolpert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wolpert) and [William Macready](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=William_G._Macready&action=edit&redlink=1) appears in the 1997 "No Free Lunch Theorems for Optimization".[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem#cite_note-WM97.1-1) Wolpert had previously derived no free lunch theorems for [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning) (statistical inference).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem#cite_note-Wolpert96-2) The name alludes to the saying "[there ain't no such thing as a free lunch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/There_ain%27t_no_such_thing_as_a_free_lunch)", that is, there are no easy shortcuts to success.
		- In 2005, Wolpert and Macready themselves indicated that the first theorem in their paper "state[s] that any two [optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimization_(mathematics)) algorithms are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible problems".[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem#cite_note-WM-coev-3)
		- Posit a toy universe that exists for exactly two days and on each day contains exactly one object, a square or a triangle. The universe has exactly four possible histories:
			- (square, triangle): the universe contains a square on day 1, and a triangle on day 2
			- (square, square)
			- (triangle, triangle)
			- (triangle, square)
			-
			-
			- Any prediction strategy that succeeds for history #2, by predicting a square on day 2 if there is a square on day 1, will fail on history #1, and vice versa. If all histories are equally likely, then any prediction strategy will score the same, with the same accuracy rate of 0.5.[[8]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_free_lunch_theorem#cite_note-8)

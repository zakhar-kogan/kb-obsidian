		- Every [[blockchain]] follows an underlying protocol that determines its block selection [[process]], how [[Network]] nodes validate transactions, transaction finality characteristics, [[supply]] issuance, supply distribution, and what determines the “true” state of the [[Network]]. Furthermore, the blockchain protocol provides an [[incentive]] structure for [[Network]] participants to behave honestly with each other while discouraging bad actors.
		- A Sybil attack is an exploit against an online [[Network]] whereby a small number of entities (as few as one) attempt to take [[control]] of the whole [[Network]] by leveraging multiple accounts, nodes, or computers. On [[social]] media platforms, a user can generate multiple accounts and spam the [[Network]], effectively "taking over" the conversation. On a blockchain, bad actors might run multiple nodes to achieve an overwhelming influence on the [[Network]].
		- The word "Sybil" comes from a case study about a woman named Sybil Dorsett, a pseudonym for Shirley Ardell Mason, who received treatment for dissociative identity disorder, or multiple personality disorder.[[1]] Once an attacker creates enough Sybil identities to disproportionately influence a [[crypto]] [[Network]], they can refuse to receive or transmit blocks, effectively preventing other users from the [[Network]].
		  
		  The most commonly-known Sybil attack in the [[crypto]] space is the "51% attack," where attackers take over most of the [[Network]] computing power, commonly referred to as “hash rate.” In such cases, they may theoretically influence the ordering of transactions, prevent the confirmation of new transactions, and double-spend their cryptoassets. Resistance to these attacks is essential for a well-functioning, [[decentralized]] blockchain.

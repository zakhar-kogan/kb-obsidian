	- For each document, a unique  `_id`  attribute is stored automatically. To build a relation (i.e., an edge) between two documents (i.e., vertices), both  `_id`  attributes are stored in a special edge document known as  `_from`  and  `_to`  attributes, forming a directed connection between two arbitrary vertices. Edges are then stored in a special edge collection.

	- For each document, a unique  `_id`  attribute is stored automatically. To build a relation (i.e., an edge) between two documents (i.e., vertices), both  `_id`  attributes are stored in a special edge document known as  `_from`  and  `_to`  attributes, forming a directed connection between two arbitrary vertices. Edges are then stored in a special edge collection.

	- Vertices and edges are both full JSON documents and can hold arbitrary data. By this approach combined with the edge index, ArangoDB is one of the few graph databases capable of horizontal scaling. Each edge and vertex can contain complex data in the form of nested propertiesю

	- For each document, a unique  `_id`  attribute is stored automatically. To build a relation (i.e., an edge) between two documents (i.e., vertices), both  `_id`  attributes are stored in a special edge document known as  `_from`  and  `_to`  attributes, forming a directed connection between two arbitrary vertices. Edges are then stored in a special edge collection.

	- Vertices and edges are both full JSON documents and can hold arbitrary data. By this approach combined with the edge index, ArangoDB is one of the few graph databases capable of horizontal scaling. Each edge and vertex can contain complex data in the form of nested propertiesю
	- So the simplest edge would be the line that connected you to a friend. However, what if this connection went one step further and described more things about your relationship? You could include details that are common among you, such as the fact that you both love Avocados (who doesn’t!?) and then when you wanted to find friends to join you for the Avocado Festival you could easily query that information. This would allow for things such as suggesting new friends, finding events based on you and your friends matching interests, or even recording important dates such as the date you became friends or other shared life events.
	- The details that make up the things you like, the things your friends like, and then the things that you share in common could be thought of as the properties of you and your friendships. This concept of modeling your data with descriptive labels is how data is modeled in a property graph. Property graphs use relevant semantic labels to model your data and its connections. This means that data can be structured in a way that is easily understood by a human.

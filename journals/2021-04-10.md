## Generating Parameterized Powerpoint Documents in [[Python]] and R

### Using the `python-pptx` package to replace elements of Powerpoint presentations

We start in Python by importing some functions we need from the `python-pptx` package. In this example we only need a couple of simple functions, but I encourage you to explore the wide range of functions available in this package to edit and customize Powerpoint elements.

from pptx import Presentation  
from pptx.chart.data import CategoryChartData

Next we load in our existing dummy presentation into our Python session:

pres = Presentation("templates/ppt-template.pptx")

By examining `pres` we can see that it is a Powerpoint presentation object.

pres\## <pptx.presentation.Presentation object at 0x7fb40af62140>

`pres` is actually a complex nested XML object. But as you’d expect, it contains some slides. We can create a list of slides and check that that list contains three slides as we would expect.

slides = \[slide for slide in pres.slides\]  
len(slides)\## 3

Looks good. Now each slide contains some shapes, which can be anything from text boxes to charts, tables or diagrams.

## [Trafalgar [[library]]](https://itnext.io/trafalgar-a-python-library-to-make-quantitative-finance-and-portfolio-analysis-faster-and-easier-24b2c0cb29d4) for portfolio finance

## Adaptive experimentation, [bandit algorithm](https://ax.dev/) in [[Python]]

## Ultimate [[Python]] [library for time series analysis](https://github.com/polakowo/vectorbt) and backtesting at speed and scale ([[vector]] based)
While there are [many great backtesting packages for Python](https://github.com/mementum/backtrader#alternatives), [[vectorbt]] combines an extremely fast backtester and a [[data science]] tool: it excels at processing performance and offers interactive tools to explore [[complex]] phenomena in trading. With it, you can traverse a huge number of strategy configurations, time periods, and instruments in little time, to explore where your strategy performs best and to uncover hidden patterns in data.

## Very fast charting [[python]] [library](https://github.com/finos/perspective)
Originally developed for J.P. Morgan's trading business, Perspective makes it simple to build user-configurable analytics entirely in the browser, or in concert with Python and/or [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). Use it to create reports, dashboards, notebooks and applications, with static data or streaming updates via [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/).

## [ffn](https://pmorissette.github.io/ffn/) - Financial Functions for [[Python]]
ffn is a library that contains many useful functions for those who work in **quantitative [[finance]]**. It stands on the shoulders of giants ([[Pandas]], [[Numpy]], Scipy, etc.) and provides a vast array of utilities, from performance measurement and evaluation to graphing and common data transformations.

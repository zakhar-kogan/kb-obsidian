-   _Uni v3 LP positions can be decomposed into a short put payoff and a range component._
-   _The value of a Uni v3 position is the sum of 1) a short put, whose value is given by the Black-Scholes model, and 2) a range term, whose closed-form expression is found using the Feynman-Kac formula._
-   _This can be simplified further by converting the Uni v3 LP position into a “fixed-DTE” put option whose value at expiration converges to a put option at time T_r > 0 ._
-   _Comparing the expected returns and the options premium of a Uni v3 position can help determine whether it is more beneficial to hold a Uni v3 position or to “lend” it to an options buyer. Spoiler alert: It is almost* always better to lend a Uni v3 option_ 🤯

, where S is the price of the asset in terms of the numéraire, K is the strike price √(tL*tH), and r is the range factor √(tH/tL). The range factor determines how “sharp” the transition between holding the asset and the numéraire is.

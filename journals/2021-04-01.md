It inhibited [[PDE4]]D2, PDE4B2, PDE5A1, and PDE9A2 with the IC(50) values of 2.9, 4.5, >40, and >100 μM, respectively.
## [[Quercetin]]

PDE4 inhibition by quercetin approximates that of known [[PDE4]] inhibitors rolipram and Ro-20-1724, with IC50 values of 9.9, 2.3, and 8.7 μM, respectively
### https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18264679/
In the present results, the [[PDE4]](H)/PDE4(L) ratios of quercetin (1), ayanin (3), and QPME (5) were >30, >19, and 11, respectively (Table 1), which are higher than or equal to that of AWD12-281, the selective PDE4 inhibitor with the greatest potential currently undergoing clinical trials for treating asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.

## [[Aloe]]

## [[Hesperetin]]
https://www.hindawi.com/journals/ecam/2012/472897/: Their [[PDE4]] IC50 values were, respectively, calculated to be 45.6+-2.3 and 3.6+-1.8 (rolipram)
## [[Luteolin]]
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19853596/: According to the Lineweaver-Burk analysis, luteolin (3-30 microM) competitively inhibited [[PDE]]1-5 activities, with K(i) values of 15.0, 6.4, 13.9, 11.1, and 9.5 microM, respectively, which did not significantly differ from each other.
# Natural [[PPAR]] agonists
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17152989/
The most active extracts for [[PPAR]], for which a concentration dependent effect could be shown, were the extracts of Alisma plantago aquatica (ze xie/european waterplantain), Catharanthus roseus (madagascar periwinkle), Acorus calamus (sweet calamus), Euphorbia balsamifera (balsam spurge), Jatropha curcas (barbados nut), Origanum majorana (marjoram), Zea mays (corn silk), Capsicum frutescens (chilli) and Urtica dioica (stinging [[nettle]]).
## [[Carnosid acid]], [[carnosol]]
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16858665/
Subsequent analysis of the characteristic constituents revealed the phenolic diterpene compounds carnosol, present in both herbs, and carnosic acid to be active principles of these extracts, showing EC (50) values of 41.2 +/- 5.9 microM and 19.6 +/- 2.0 microM, respectively.
Thus it can be concluded that the glucose lowering effect reported recently for rosemary may be attributed to [[PPAR]]gamma activation.
## [[Bavachinin]]
https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00125-016-3912-9
Notably, BVC showed stronger activities with [[PPAR]]-γ than with PPAR-α and PPAR-β/δ (EC50 = 0.74 μmol/l, 4.00 μmol/l and 8.07 μmol/l, respectively.

## [[Honokiol]] etc
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211383517301624#s0015
Undoubtedly, the greatest part of these research efforts has been devoted to find [[PPAR]]γ modulators, in the search for natural products able to improve metabolic parameters in diabetic animal models, with reduced side effects when compared to thiazolidinedione, full agonists of this receptor. [[Honokiol]], amorfrutins, and amorphastilbol are nice examples of molecules possessing these positive features, also because, in some cases, their mechanism of action includes the simultaneous activation of PPARα (as in the case of amorphastibol) or the [[PPAR]]γ-dimer partner retinoid X receptor (as in the case of honokiol).
## [[Carvacrol]], [[thymol]]
A [[PPAR]]_α_ modulating activity has been reported for the acyclic monoterpene [[linalool]] and for the two isomeric aromatic monoterpenes [[carvacrol]] and [[thymol]]

[[Carvacrol]] (5) and [[thymol]] (6), monocyclic aromatic monoterpenes of thyme oil, were found to be somewhat weak agonists of [[PPAR]]α and PPARγ receptors and, at the same time, to suppress the expression of COX-2.
[[Linalool]] is contained in most herbal essential oils and teas, where it contributes to the definition of aroma and flavors. The mixture of l- and d-linalool was found to act as a direct ligand of [[PPAR]]α reducing cellular lipid accumulation, inducing fatty acid oxidation and significantly reducing the concentrations of saturated fatty acids, effects which were markedly attenuated by silencing [[PPAR]]α expression. The effects of 1 mmol/L linalool appeared comparable to those of 0.1 mmol/L fenofibrate.
## Diterpenes
A series of diterpenes have been reported to be able to modulate PPARα although, almost invariably, these compounds were dual [[PPAR]]α/γ activators. This is the case of [[dehydroabietic acid]], a major component of the oleoresin produced by several conifer species.
## [[Ginsenosides]]
The pentacyclic triterpene oleanolic acid was found to stimulate PPARα activation in keratinocytes while, interestingly, the closely related ursolic acid, differing only for the methylation pattern on ring E, failed to express this activity27. The steroidal saponins [[ginsenosides]], recognized as the main responsible for the pharmacological activities of [[ginseng]], have been disclosed to inhibit the induction of [[PPAR]]α-target genes by acting as competitive inhibitors of PPARα, with a consequent increased serum concentrations of total cholesterol, triglycerides, and HDL cholesterol28. One of the ginsenosides, namely ginsenoside Rf (16), was identified as the most potent analogue in this activity. 
## [[Hops]]
Isohumulone (24) and isocohumulone (25), are among the main bitter agents, responsible for the taste imparted by hop (Humulus lupulus L.) to beer. These compounds, formed by isomerization of humulones during the brewing process, have been found to activate [[PPAR]]α and -γ with a positive effect on dyslipidemia in diabetic animals.
## [[Oregano]]
[[Rosmarinic acid]], the main phenylpropanoid of [[oregano]] extract showed a moderate [[PPAR]]α transactivaction activity (about 20% when compared to WY14643)
## [[Sesame]]
[[Sesamin]], a major lignan of sesame seeds, upregulates the [[PPAR]]α-associated signaling and downregulates the liver X receptor α (LXRα)-mediated pathway, a combined effect that induces an evident improvement of hepatic steatosis and related inflammation.
## [[Resveratrol]]
Resveratrol is probably one of the most intensely investigated phytochemicals and surely the best known [[stilbene]]. A plethora of pharmacological activities have been attributed to this [[flavonoid]], present in the skin and seeds of grapes but also in many other natural sources. A series of experiments on several cells have shown that resveratrol activates the nuclear receptors PPARα and [[PPAR]]γ. However, the activity of this stilbene seems to be higher when the oxidative state of the cell is stronger and to decrease as the effect of oxidants decrease.
## [[Pterostilbene]]
In agreement with this conclusion, the activity of resveratrol is shared by its dimethylated analogue [[pterostilbene]] (37), which indeed maintains a free hydroxyl group at position 4′. Actually, the agonistic activity of 37 on [[PPAR]]α is even higher than that of resveratrol, probably due to the beneficial lowering of polarity on ring A.
## [[Icariin]]
Icariin, a glycosylated and prenylated flavonol obtained from Epimedium brevicornum Maxim (a traditional Chinese herb known as Yin Yang Huo), up-regulated [[PPAR]]α and PPARγ protein levels. This effect, combined to the already known inhibition of [[NF-κB]] expression, can explain the potent neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects attributed to this compound.
## [[EGCG]]
Epigallocatechin-3-gallate ([[EGCG]]), the major polyphenolic constituent of green [[tea]] (Camellia sinensis), increases the expression of [[PPAR]]α and confers susceptibility to cancer cells via suppression of the enzyme heme oxygenase-1
## [Berberine](Berberine)
The isoquinoline alkaloid [[berberine]] has been shown to have a body weight reducing effect in diabetic rats, mediated by hypolipidemic effects, including restoration of normal total [[cholesterol]], [[triglyceride]], fatty acid and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels. These effects are likely to be, at least partly, mediated by the selective activation of [[PPAR]]α: berberine binds directly to the LBD of PPARα with similar affinity to fenofibrate.

Most of blockchain protocols are designed or analyzed as [economic games](https://blog.ethereum.org/2015/12/28/understanding-serenity-part-2-casper/). However, the basic assumptions in the underlying traditional economics, that is rational agents and well-defined problems, break as soon as we consider more complex coordination problems on top of these blockchain protocols. For a discussion of tokenization as complex coordination problem refer to [Foundations of Cryptoeconomic Systems](https://epub.wu.ac.at/7309/8/Foundations%20of%20Cryptoeconomic%20Systems.pdf) and [Token Economy](https://github.com/Token-Economy-Book/EnglishOriginal/wiki). For a discussion of assumptions and better economic models refer to [Foundations of complexity economics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42254-020-00273-3) and [The ergodicity problem in economics](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41567-019-0732-0).

Why we still are interested in games, has very practical reasons. Games are how non-technical participants can understand system dynamics. Games are how technical participants get to appreciate how wonderfully unpredictable, ingenious, players will act, react, and interact with and within the designed game structure. Over half a century ago, gaming was rediscovered, for its same properties we are interested now: as ["The Future's Language"](https://de.slideshare.net/pvdhyden/74duke-gaming-the-futures-language)

> „the prime purpose of gaming/simulation is to establish dialogue to increase communication among a group about a topic which is complex, future-oriented, of a systems nature, and which requires a vocabulary or vernacular which is not commonly shared by the group at the outset of the discussion.“

We rediscovered games in token engineering not only because of its potential for multilogue, experiential learning, and co-creation in participatory networks; but also because the specific game we encountered ["Le Grand Jeu"](https://github.com/freddbomba/legrandjeu/blob/master/doc/legrandjeu.md) had the same game mechanics as the components of [cadCAD](https://github.com/cadCAD-org/cadCAD), the first open sourced computer-aided design library available to token engineers. This connection is explained in more detail in section "Computer-aided Design". For general insights on designing simulation games refer to [Simulation games- a concise introduction to the design process](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264543759_Simulation_games_-_a_concise_introduction_to_the_design_process). For a detailed recount of how to facilitate a simulation game refer to [A practitioner researcher perspective on facilitating an open, infinite, chaordic simulation](https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/2100/308). I particularly like this reference because it gives insights into the same topics and theories of interest in token model generation from the perspective of facilitating simulations games - which seems very much align with the recent insights [on leadership in the 21st century](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3vX2iVIJMFQ).

More aware participants also start to analyze their own thinking in systems, and challenge their own paradigms. This learning opportunity is what systems thinkers have identified as the [highest leverage point in systems thinking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_leverage_points#1._Power_to_transcend_paradigms):

> "Transcending paradigms may go beyond challenging fundamental assumptions, into the realm of changing the values and priorities that lead to the assumptions, and being able to choose among value sets at will."

Defining characteristics of a game are said to be having a goal, rules, a feedback system. For a deep dive refer to [Reality is broken: How games make us better and how they can change the world](https://janemcgonigal.com/play-me/). "Ability to win" is not the defining characteristic of a game, especially in simulation games. This is also well explained in ["Infinite Games"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Infinite_Game). Whether we are cooperative or competitive and what the game should foster may be open design questions. We know that humans are extraordinarily cooperative. It is empirically shown how [cooperation evolved as a competitive strategy](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-14416-8). When we design policies it is very interesting to look for positive sum games, and consciously choose these over win-lose zero-sum games. We will also look into motivations of players. Eypecially when we design incentive mechanisms, we must not ignore the detrimental effects of extrinsic rewards on intrinsic motivation. In practice, things that must be done or are repetitive can be incentivized by the act of gamification. We cannot ignore that overly competitive simplistic zero-sum games such as Monopoly leave no space for any of these alternatives. In one of our case studies, [The Invisible Economy](https://powerdada.medium.com/the-invisible-economy-db46897d4f07), we follow the primacy of intrinsic motivations. The assumption is that for any action that is needed by the collective there is an individual who will act out of pure intrinsic motivation no matter the nature of the task. Leaping a bit into the future, we see that all repetitive tasks can be automated and that intrinsically motivated participants create prosocial positive-sum games.

A good game has a consistent narrative that inspires the players. A good briefing of the narrative in early game design should capture the motivation and trigger the imagination of "early players" to help fil in the gaps. The storyline should incorporate dilemmas and surprises such that players must make meaningful decisions and take actions that generate insights. Most valuable are insights into player's reasoning and motivations, which will inform the useful incentive mechanism design. Surprises ensure that we see the differences in policies play out dynamically. Where computer simulations can help us see unintended consequences of policies over time and under changing conditions, game simulations help us see how players' policies can change and change the game.

# [Twelve leverage points - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twelve_leverage_points)
### 12. Constants, parameters, numbers[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twelve_leverage_points&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: 12. Constants, parameters, numbers")]

Parameters are points of lowest leverage effects. Though they are the most clearly perceived among all leverages, they rarely change behaviors and therefore have little long-term effect.

> For example, climate parameters may not be changed easily (the amount of rain, the [evapotranspiration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evapotranspiration "Evapotranspiration") rate, the temperature of the water), but they are the ones people think of first (they remember that in their youth, it was certainly raining more). These parameters are indeed very important. But even if changed (improvement of upper river stream to canalize incoming water), they will not change behavior much (the debit will probably not dramatically decrease).

### 11. The size of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twelve_leverage_points&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: 11. The size of buffers and other stabilizing stocks, relative to their flows")]

A [buffer](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Buffer "wiktionary:Buffer")'s ability to stabilize a system is important when the stock amount is much higher than the potential amount of inflows or outflows. In the lake, the water is the buffer: if there's a lot more of it than inflow/outflow, the system stays stable.

> For example, the inhabitants are worried the lake fish might die as a consequence of hot water release directly in the lake without any previous cooling off. However, the water in the lake has a large [heat capacity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_capacity "Heat capacity"), so it's a strong thermic buffer. Provided the release is done at low enough depth, under the [thermocline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermocline "Thermocline"), and the lake volume is big enough, the buffering capacity of the water might prevent any extinction from excess temperature.

Buffers can improve a system, but they are often physical entities whose size is critical and can't be changed easily.

### 10. Structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport network, population age structures)[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twelve_leverage_points&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: 10. Structure of material stocks and flows (such as transport network, population age structures)")]

A system's structure may have enormous effect on operations, but may be difficult or prohibitively expensive to change. Fluctuations, limitations, and bottlenecks may be easier to address.

> For example, the inhabitants are worried about their lake getting polluted, as the industry releases chemical pollutants directly in the water without any previous treatment. The system might need the used water to be diverted to a [wastewater treatment plant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Industrial_wastewater_treatment "Industrial wastewater treatment"), but this requires rebuilding the underground used water system (which could be quite expensive).

### 9. Length of delays, relative to the rate of system changes[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twelve_leverage_points&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: 9. Length of delays, relative to the rate of system changes")]

Information received too quickly or too late can cause over- or underreaction, even oscillations.

> For example, the city council is considering building the wastewater treatment plant. However, the plant will take 5 years to be built, and will last about 30 years. The first delay will prevent the water being cleaned up within the first 5 years, while the second delay will make it impossible to build a plant with exactly the right capacity.

### 8. Strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the effect they are trying to correct against[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twelve_leverage_points&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: 8. Strength of negative feedback loops, relative to the effect they are trying to correct against")]

A [negative feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_feedback "Negative feedback") loop slows down a process, tending to promote stability. The loop will keep the stock near the goal, thanks to parameters, accuracy and speed of information feedback, and size of correcting flows.

> For example, one way to avoid the lake getting more and more polluted might be through setting up an additional levy on the industrial plant based on measured concentrations of its effluent. Say the plant management has to pay into a water management fund, on a weekly or monthly basis, depending on the actual amount of waste found in the lake; they will, in this case, receive a direct benefit not just from reducing their waste output, but actually reducing it enough to achieve the desired effect of reducing concentrations in the lake. They cannot benefit from "doing damage more slowly" -- only from actually helping. If cutting emissions, even to zero, is insufficient to allow the lake to naturally purge the waste, then they will still be on the hook for cleanup. This is similar to the US "Superfund" system, and follows the widely accepted "polluter pays" principle.

### 7. Gain around driving positive feedback loops[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twelve_leverage_points&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: 7. Gain around driving positive feedback loops")]

A [positive feedback](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive_feedback "Positive feedback") loop speeds up a process. Meadows indicates that in most cases, it is preferable to slow down a positive loop, rather than speeding up a negative one.

> The [eutrophication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eutrophication "Eutrophication") of a lake is a typical feedback loop that goes wild. In a eutrophic lake (which means well-nourished), much life, including fish, can be supported. An increase of [nutrients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient "Nutrient") will lead to an increase of productivity, growth of [phytoplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phytoplankton "Phytoplankton") first, using up as much nutrients as possible, followed by growth of [zooplankton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zooplankton "Zooplankton"), feeding up on the first ones, and increase of fish populations. The more available nutrients there are, the more productivity is increased. As plankton organisms die, they fall to the bottom of the lake, where their matter is degraded by decomposers. However, this degradation uses up available [oxygen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxygen "Oxygen"), and in the presence of huge amounts of organic matter to degrade, the medium progressively becomes [anoxic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoxia_(environmental) "Hypoxia (environmental)") (there is no more oxygen available). In time, all oxygen-dependent life dies, and the lake becomes a smelly anoxic place where no life can be supported (in particular no fish).

### 6. Structure of information flow (who does and does not have access to what kinds of information)[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twelve_leverage_points&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: 6. Structure of information flow (who does and does not have access to what kinds of information)")]

[Information flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_flow_(disambiguation) "Information flow (disambiguation)") is neither a parameter, nor a reinforcing or slowing loop, but a loop that delivers new information. It is cheaper and easier to change information flows than it is to change structure.

> For example, a monthly public report of water pollution level, especially nearby the industrial release, could have a lot of effect on people's opinions regarding the industry, and lead to changes in the waste water level of pollution.

### 5. Rules of the system (such as incentives, punishment, constraints)[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twelve_leverage_points&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: 5. Rules of the system (such as incentives, punishment, constraints)")]

Pay attention to rules, and to who makes them.

> For example, a strengthening of the law related to chemicals release limits, or an increase of the tax amount for any water containing a given pollutant, will have a very strong effect on the lake water quality.

### 4. Power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twelve_leverage_points&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: 4. Power to add, change, evolve, or self-organize system structure")]

[Self-organization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-organization "Self-organization") describes a system's ability to change itself by creating new structures, adding new negative and positive feedback loops, promoting new information flows, or making new rules.

> For example, microorganisms have the ability to not only change to fit their new polluted environment, but also to undergo an evolution that makes them able to biodegrade or bioaccumulate chemical pollutants. This capacity of part of the system to participate in its own [eco-evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eco-evolution "Eco-evolution") is a major leverage for change.

### 3. Goal of the system[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twelve_leverage_points&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: 3. Goal of the system")]

Changing goals changes every item listed above: parameters, feedback loops, information and self-organization.

> A city council decision might be to change the goal of the lake from making it a free facility for public and private use, to a more [tourist](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ecotourism "Ecotourism") oriented facility or a [conservation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_ethic "Conservation ethic") area. That goal change will effect several of the above leverage points: information on water quality will become mandatory and legal punishment will be set for any illegal effluent.

### 2. Mindset or paradigm that the system — its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters — arises from[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twelve_leverage_points&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: 2. Mindset or paradigm that the system — its goals, structure, rules, delays, parameters — arises from")]

A societal paradigm is an idea, a shared unstated assumption, or a system of thought that is the foundation of complex social structures. Paradigms are very hard to change, but there are no limits to paradigm change. Meadows indicates paradigms might be changed by repeatedly and consistently pointing out anomalies and failures in the current paradigm to those with open minds.

_A current paradigm is "Nature is a stock of resources to be converted to human purpose". What might happen to the lake were this collective idea changed ?_

### 1. Power to transcend paradigms[[edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Twelve_leverage_points&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: 1. Power to transcend paradigms")]

Transcending paradigms may go beyond challenging fundamental assumptions, into the realm of changing the values and priorities that lead to the assumptions, and being able to choose among value sets at will.

> Many today see Nature as a stock of resources to be converted to human purpose. Many Native Americans see Nature as a living god, to be loved, worshipped, and lived with. These views are incompatible, but perhaps another viewpoint could incorporate them both, along with others.

	- **[[Control theory]]** deals with the [control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system "Control system") of [dynamical systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamical_system "Dynamical system") in engineered processes and machines. The objective is to develop a model or algorithm governing the application of system inputs to drive the system to a desired state, while minimizing any _delay_, _overshoot_, or _steady-state error_ and ensuring a level of control [stability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stability_theory "Stability theory"); often with the aim to achieve a degree of [optimality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimal_control "Optimal control").
	- To do this, a **controller** with the requisite corrective behavior is required. This controller monitors the controlled [process variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_variable "Process variable") (PV), and compares it with the reference or [set point](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setpoint_(control_system) "Setpoint (control system)") (SP). The difference between actual and desired value of the process variable, called the _error_ signal, or SP-PV error, is applied as feedback to generate a control action to bring the controlled process variable to the same value as the set point. Other aspects which are also studied are [controllability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controllability "Controllability") and [observability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability "Observability"). Control theory is used in [control system engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_system_engineering "Control system engineering") to design automation that have revolutionized manufacturing, aircraft, communications and other industries, and created new fields such as [robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotics "Robotics").
	- Extensive use is usually made of a diagrammatic style known as the [block diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_diagram "Block diagram"). In it the [transfer function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_function "Transfer function"), also known as the system function or network function, is a mathematical model of the relation between the input and output based on the [differential equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation "Differential equation") describing the system.

**The tension lies in what to automate and who is deciding what to automate. That’s where [[governance]] begins - in the design layer and in who has the ability to create the rules.**

![](Pasted%20image%2020221201131309.png)
Another major element of context is that in addition to social & technical - in Web3, we are now adding an economic layer into these [[socio-technical systems]].

Combining social, technical and economic dynamics can have a high degree of [[complexity]] - in relation to trade-offs - when trying to design to meet a “goal” or requirements of a community in initial and ongoing design in governance systems.

BlockScience [[governance]] researcher Burrrata further outlines important distinctions between governance and [[politics]] in this excerpt from his notes on governance surfaces  (a term we will see in Section 4, Part A):  
  
_"Governance implies decision making._ _Decision making implies that things can change._ _Most things change._

_Governance controls what can change and how those things can change._

_From Wikipedia: Governance is the way rules, norms and actions are structured, sustained, regulated and held accountable._

_Politics controls what does or does not change and why._

_From Wikipedia: Politics is the set of activities that are associated with making decisions in groups, or other forms of power relations between individuals, such as the distribution of resources or status._

_For example, in the physical world how things can change is dependent on the laws of nature. We did not create nature, nor do we control it. As a result, from our perspective, the laws of nature are immutable. Nature governs what we can and can’t do in the physical world. We can move a pile of dirt, but we can’t change the laws of physics that control dirt._

_In the social world, things are more complex. How things can change is dependent on the laws of a system, but the laws are created by man (not nature). Actors within social systems have two options. They can act within the constraints of the system’s laws, or they can act to change the laws themselves. With enough political power any law created by man can be changed. The laws of man are only as strong as the political will that supports them._

_This differentiates the laws of the natural world (which we do not control) from the laws of the social world (which we do control). Any system created and controlled by humans implies that the laws of that system can be changed by humans. The power to change those laws, and the process through which that power is wielded, is governance. Acting within those rules is politics. Every system is a system of systems, so political actions at one level might govern over the rules of systems. It’s turtles governance all the way down."

**Governance and [Game theory](Game%20theory)**
A lot of the dialogue that you'll hear in crypto and Web3 is focusing on discrete event games. In Token Engineering we're looking at dynamic games, and with respect to governance especially - and specifically our definition - because the participants are acting on, and can shape, the field of action - which becomes a dynamic, evolutionary and iterative game.

The field of action in token-based systems generally involves choosing parameters which affect incentives and stakeholder alignment. As governors, we must understand the iterative nature and the complexity of socio-technical systems and that we can’t “engineer” governance per se, as these are evolving living systems. We can understand trade-offs in mechanism design, we can engineer parts, and we can use cadCAD or other modeling and simulation tools to understand reachable states in the field of action in the system - but we cannot engineer outcomes. To go deeper on dynamic games, see the following references below.

Ultimately, (governance) form follows (system) function -- **the organizational form of an institution needs to follow the function it intends to optimize for.**   
  
For example - if a token-based economy is delivering a product or service focused purely on making money - plutocracy is not necessarily a "bad choice". **Plutocracy** in that case - **is in the eye of the "bagholder"** (💰😉🤣) and other political ideologies don't matter if the system is being optimized for a financial goal, with financers as majority stakeholders.

Tokenization opens a new field where governance can now be commodified, or represent an asset. Mixing financial capital and governance stake can have many affects and consequences on communities and systems, in ways we are just beginning to explore.

### Q&As
**What are some of the dynamics & issues surrounding the commodification of governance?**
* LEGAL - Using governance tokens to "avoid" regulation  
* FINANCIALIZATION - "Assets" (governance) can be used in lending, investing & bribery, increasing attack vectors & chances for unintended consequences  
* LACK OF ID SYSTEMS - No mature systems yet offer protection from Sybil attacks  
* TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY - Very deep understanding required for security vulnerabilities in various layers of tech

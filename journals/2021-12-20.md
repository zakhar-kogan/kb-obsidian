1. [Anxiety: tianeptine ( Stablon, Coaxil ) versus fluoxetine ( Prozac )](https://www.tianeptine.com/anxiolytic.html)
2. [Tianeptine ( Stablon ) versus sertraline ( Zoloft) for anxious depression: role of serotonin](https://www.tianeptine.com/anxiety-comp.html)
3. https://www.tianeptine.com/hpa-acth.html => Chronic, but not acute, tianeptine treatment (10 mg/kg twice a day for 15 days, i.p.) attenuated LPS-induced increase of plasma ACTH and corticosterone in rats

5. https://www.tianeptine.com/forebrain.html => We found that the serotonin modulators fluoxetine and tianeptine, but not desipramine, increase the density of 5-HT and serotonin transporter (SERT)-immunoreactive axons in the neocortical layer IV and certain forebrain limbic areas, such as piriform cortex and the shell region of nucleus accumbens. These changes were noted in the absence of a significant effect of serotonin antidepressants on the expression of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH-2), i.e. the rate-limiting enzyme for 5-HT biosynthesis and of SERT at the mRNA level.
6. https://www.tianeptine.com/cytokines.html => Chronic tianeptine treatment attenuated LPS-induced expression of TNF-alpha in the spleen as well as plasma levels of this cytokine and altered the central balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta/IL-10).
7. https://www.tianeptine.com/comparisons.html => Further analysis based on clinical global impression (CGI) items found no significant difference, except for CGI item 3 (therapeutic index), where a tendency (P=0.06 or 0.07 depending on the methodology) was found in favor of tianeptine. All in all, this study confirmed that tianeptine is at least as effective as SSRI, with a trend for a better acceptability profile in the treatment of depressed patients.
8. [Tianeptine ( Stablon, Coaxil ) versus fluoxetine ( Prozac )](https://www.tianeptine.com/fluoxetinecomp.html) => The success rate at the end of the treatment (MADRS < or = 10) was significantly higher in the fluoxetine group (fluoxetine group: 48.4% vs tianeptine group: 28.1%) (p = 0.005).

## [TECHNICAL LEADERSHIP MASTERCLASS](https://ruthmalan.com/Journal/2019/20190629SlideDocTechnicalLeadershipDecisions.pdf)

Leadership plays a role when we’re trying to do something bigger than what we can accomplish alone.

The demands on expertise and experience, increase with impact. Further, as the scope or span of impact increases (that is, the decision has impact across team and other organizational or system boundaries), so too do the organizational challenges.

> 'Limiting or closing off alternatives is the most common understanding of the term "constraint."
>— Alicia Juarrero

Decisions constrain—they eliminate options. Alicia Juarrero observes that this is what we commonly mean by constraint—this limiting or closing off of alternatives; this altering of the probability distribution of available alternatives. But! In so doing, Alicia notes, they make the system "diverge from chance, from randomness.“

Decisions will be made ‐‐ Implicitly or Explicitly; Intentionally or Accidentally

>"Think of constraints not just as a restrictions, but as changes in probability of what's going on, changes in the likelihood of something" 
>— Alicia Juarrero

“parts interact to produce novel, emergent wholes; in turn, these distributed wholes as wholes regulate and constrain the parts that make them up”

>"the last responsible moment: the moment at which failing
to make a decision eliminates an important alternative."
>— Mary and Tom Poppendieck

YouArentGonnaNeedIt (often abbreviated YAGNI, or YagNi on this wiki) is an ExtremeProgramming practice which states: "Always implement things when you actually need them, never when  you just foresee that you need them."

>"Some decisions are consequential and irreversible or
nearly irreversible and these decisions must be made methodically, carefully, slowly, with great deliberation and consultation.' "
— Jeff Bezos

1. Put things on a reversibility/consequence grid — irreversible and high consequence decisions likely require more time. The rest of the time you can usually go fast.
2. The rule of 5. Think about what the decision looks like 5 days, 5 weeks, 5 months, 5 years, 5 decades
3. Let other people’s hindsight become your foresight. Do the research; draw on expertise.
4. Ask what information would cause you to change your mind. If you don’t have that information, find it. If you do, track it religiously
5. Walk around the decision from the perspective of everyone implicated (shareholders, employees, regulators, customers, partners, etc.)
6. Ask yourself “and then what?", and "what if?" and "what else?"

"If you're good at course correcting, being wrongmay be less costly than you think" — JeffBezos

[Consequence Scanning] is an important approach to discovering the wider impacts of our technical products and choices. Ask: 
• What are the intended and unintended consequences of this product or feature? 
• What are the positive consequences we want to focus on? 
• What are the consequences we want to mitigate?

Tip: Document Decisions 
Title: short noun phrase
Context: desired outcomes and the forces at play
(probably in tension) + Alternatives
Decision: describes our response to these forces
Status: proposed, accepted, deprecated, or superseded
Consequences: describes the resulting context, after
applying the decision

‘better expression than “common sense”is contextual sense — a knowledge of whatisreasonable within a context’ — Eb Rechtin

At a recent conference, Diana Montalion shared her definition of wisdom: Wisdom = knowledge + experience + good judgment According to this definition, wisdom is the ability to know what “it depends” on.

"Always design a thing by considering it in its next larger context - a chair in a room, a room in a house, a house in an environment, an environment in a city."
— Eliel Saarinen

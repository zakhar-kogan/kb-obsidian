# Scaling of Greenhouse Crop Production in Low Sunlight Environments
## Abstract
This study focuses specifically on the use of low-tech greenhouses in the event of a global catastrophe such as nuclear winter, in which sunlight and temperatures are greatly reduced across the globe.

The study used a nuclear winter climate model to determine the necessary greenhouse conditions and designed the structures to utilize global markets for materials such as timber, polymer film, construction aggregates etc.

The added cost of low-tech greenhouses is about two orders of magnitude lower than the added cost of artificial light growth, and according to the proposed scaling method, the greenhouses will provide 36% of food requirements for everyone by the end of the first year, and feed everyone after 30 months.

## Method
### Low-tech greenhouse
A-frame design was selected to maximize light transmission and enhance structural stability for connecting structures without needing to bend or further manipulate rigid wood.

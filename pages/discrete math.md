- # Set theory
- ## Set
	- A number of elements; order and repetition don't matter.
	- $\{1,3,4,5\} = \{1,1,1,1,4,3,5\} = \{5,3,4,1\}$
	- A is a subset of B if all the elements of A are in B: $A\subseteq B$
	- ### Set-roster notation
		- If there are a lot of elements in a set AND there is some clear pattern to them, we can use a set-roster notation: $\{0,2,4,6...\}$

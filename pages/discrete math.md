- # Set theory
- ## Set
	- A number of elements; order and repetition don't matter.
	- $\{1,3,4,5\} = \{1,1,1,1,4,3,5\} = \{5,3,4,1\}$
	- A is a subset of B if all the elements of A are in B: $A\in B$
	- ### Set-roster notation
		- If there are a lot of elements in a set AND there is some clear pattern to them, we can use a set-roster notation: $\{0,2,4,6...\}, \{...-6,-4,-2,0,2,4,6...\}$
	- ### Set-builder notation
		- If there are a lot of elements, but no clear pattern => we can denote the elements using a function, essentially a lambda function with "such that": $\{x|x=twice\ a\ number\}$

	- ### Empty set
		- A collection of NO objects
		- Notation: $\{\}$ or $\emptyset$
		- Is a $\emptyset$ a subset of $\{1,2,3\}$? Yes, it's the so-called *vacuous truth*
	- ### Cartesian Product of Two Sets A x B
		- Ordered pairs: order matters
		- $(a,b) = (c,d)$ if $a=c \ \&\ b=d$
		- *a, b* can come from [[different]] sets
		- Cartesian product $A\times B$ is the set of all ordered pairs (a,b) where $a\in A$ and $b\in B$
		- $A \{a,b\} \times B \{0,1\} = \{(a,0), (a,1), (b,0), (b,1)\}$
	- ### Function, formal definition
		- Function F between A and B is:
			- For every element $x \in A$ there is an element $y \in B$ such that $(x,y) \in F$, i.e. for every input x, there's some output y, so $F(x)=y$
			- If $(x,y) \in F$ and $(x,z) \in F$, then $y=z$ => the same

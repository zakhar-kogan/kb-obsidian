- # Why network effects are critical
	- https://www.nfx.com/masterclass/network-effects/network-effects-mission-critical
	- Network effects (NE) may be the most important factor in predicting startup's success.
	- Between 2012 and 2018 70% of tech companies employed network effects.

	- Viral effects are ==not== network effects. Network effect is *every user joining the product increases its value for all the other users*, Metcalfe effect.
- # The Underlying Properties Of Network Theory
	- https://www.nfx.com/masterclass/network-effects/network-theory-properties
	- ## Basic network
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1665553803829_0.png)
	- ## Network density
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1665553841794_0.png)
	- ## White hot center
		- So if there's one node where everybody's connecting to them, then you've got the beginnings of a **white hot center** with the core node, and then the nodes that are closest to them.
	- ## Directional / non-directional / bidirectional links
		- Another important aspect of these links is that they can be **directed**. There can be direction to these. So for instance, in Twitter, you would have an influencer who is important, sending out mostly messages to people who are just reading. That would be directional in one way. Or you could have, let's say a Venmo, where people are paying each other.
	- ## 1-1 / 1-many / many-many
		- ### Sarnoff's law
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1665553956551_0.png)
			- Works for one-to-many
			- $V=n$
		- ### Metcalfe's law
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1665554007062_0.png)
			- Works for many-to-many
			- $V=n^2$
		- ### Reed's law
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1665554065662_0.png)
			- An improvement on Metcalfe's law by a MIT professor in 1999
			- Because of local clusters, the real value may grow as $V=2^n$
	- ## Critical mass
		- Or a point of inflection => **crucial** to start getting network effects.
		- So to build the network value, you need to get to critical mass. And what happens is, as your network is growing a little bit, a little bit, a little bit all the time, at some point, it hits a moment of critical mass where it takes off, it lifts off. You can feel it. It's like someone stuck two fingers in your nose and just yanks your head forward. It just starts to take off on its own. And that critical mass moment is often facilitated through **developing your clustering.**
		- Now to get these clusters going, you're going to want to find your **minimal viable cluster.** Some small group of people that once attached to each other will stay attached to each other that you can then build on. Again, maybe creating another cluster and then bridging those two clusters. That minimal viable cluster really helps you to found the overall network. Now, to get to critical mass, the product is going to have to have some value to these users, to this cluster.
		-
	- *Real > pseudonymous > anonymous* IDs
	- ## Homogeneity
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1665554488688_0.png)
		- Conversely, **homogeneity** allows you to grow your network faster, but then often leaves you more vulnerable to attack by other competitors and other networks, simply because people are interchangeable. You think about Uber, you think about Lyft, you think about businesses where the needs are very clear and obvious, but it helps you grow faster at the beginning. So it's a trade off.
	- ## Asymptoting
		- Another interesting network property is what we call **asymptoting**. And asymptoting takes place when you might be adding more nodes onto the network, but the value doesn't actually continue to grow it. So the value of an Uber network or a Lyft network asymptotes even though you keep getting more drivers on the network, because if you're putting on your jacket or getting your bag, or you need to go to the bathroom before they come, you don't really care if they come faster than 4 minutes. It's nice if they come at 3 minutes, but as long as they come in under 10 or 6, it's pretty much good. And so the value doesn't actually get much higher.
	- ## Assymetry
		- So another important network property is what we call **asymmetry**.
		- In most marketplaces, **one side is harder** than the other. In some cases, much harder than the other. Example: Outdoorsy, doing an RV marketplace. They discovered that the supply side was much harder to get because there was, let's say, 2,500 mom and pops renting out about 50,000 RVs in the United States, but there was 30 million people trying to rent those RVs.
		- So if they could build software to allow them to work with and understand where these were, they would be able to *offer that supply out for the voracious demand* that was out there and build a pretty good marketplace, which they've done.
	- ## Cross-side network effect
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1665554753592_0.png)
		- The two sides, in this case, are the supply and the demand. So the value is the more supply on the network, the more value to the demand side. So that's **cross-side network effect**, cross-side value being created, and that can be quite intense.
	- ## Negative network effects
		- ### Congestion
			- There's so many nodes on the network that are trying to use the network that the network starts to **break down**. A good example of that would be **Ethereum**, where the more people using Ethereum, the more the gas prices go up. It just becomes unaffordable to use that network.
		- ### Pollution
			- The **pollution** is when the nodes on the link are behaving badly. An example of behaving badly could be on Facebook when your grandmother gets on and she starts posting pictures of you as a kid and embarrassing you, you don't want to be on Facebook anymore.
	- ## Chicken egg problem
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1665555056315_0.png)
		- Called **network start problem** for direct effect businesses. **Chicken and egg problem** for marketplaces.
		- You can't get anyone to join your network **unless there's already somebody there**.
		- *But how do you get them to sit there long enough? How do you attract them there at all? And then once you get them there, how do you attract enough of the demand so that these people stick around?* So there's a timing issue with bringing people in at the right time.
		- **Cold start problem** => the same situation, but when you've got a network, and there's **nobody there yet**. So when the first person comes in, there's no one there. How do you teach them to stick around so that they are there for their friends when their friends arrive?
	- ## Liquidity
		- *If someone lists something for sale on your marketplace, what percentage of the time do they sell it? What percentage of the time do they get the transaction they were looking for? If someone posts on your social network, what percentage of the time do they get likes, do they get attention, do they get responses, comments?* You can actually look at liquidity, both in terms of transactions on a marketplace and in terms of interaction on a network.
	- ## Multi-tenanting
		- So if you've got a supply and you've built your marketplace for the demand, they might be using your marketplace. But like with Lyft or Uber, I could sell my services on somebody else's marketplace, number two, or maybe marketplace number three. This happens if you're selling on eBay. You also want to sell on Amazon marketplace or on Shopify or on Etsy.
		- Can you build a system where either or both, the supply and the demand do not want to **multi-tenant** so you can capture their share of wallet, capture their average order value, capture the overall annual take that you're going to be taking from them? That's one thing you need to think about when designing your marketplace is how to keep them from multi-tenanting.
	- ## Related concepts
		- ### Viral effects
			- **Viral effects** are awarding your existing users get you new users for free. There are playbooks for that and that's great, but that's not what we're talking about. Network effects are about retention. Network effects are about defensibility. And the defensibility is what ultimately adds value to your part.
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1665555627291_0.png)
			- $K=\frac {Interactions*Conversion}{time}$
			- Now, if you get a *K-factor of 1.01* for many days in a row, you will eventually start growing very geometrically. And if you can get a viral factor of 1.25, back in the day, maybe 10 or 15 years ago, it was possible to get viral factors as high as 3.0, meaning you would triple every day. And in many cases, we were registering 250,000 people a day.
			- I know of one application that was registering 2 million people a day on top of the Facebook platform. Because there was no viral delay, the invites were going out like crazy. And the conversion rate was really high because people were already on Facebook.
			- Those conditions don't exist today anymore. But understanding viral effects, understanding virality, how to measure your *K-factor can be useful to lowering your CAC* today.

- # 16 Network Effects
	- https://www.nfx.com/masterclass/network-effects/mapping-the-16-network-effects
	- ## Effects map
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1665556326681_0.png)
	- ## Direct
		- ## Physical
			- Okay, so the first time we saw a commercial application of network effects was way back, 1907. The chairman of the board of AT&T who was deploying physical phones and copper wires to connect them all together so they could talk to each other, he said in his report, his annual report, *"You know, you might want to buy our stock because what we've noticed is that when we go into a town and we get a few nodes and a few of these copper wire links, nobody can compete with us, and we end up taking all the business in the town. So in every town we get into, we own everything. We're probably going to have a pretty good business here."* He noticed it, he explained it, and he gave business reasons why it was important and boy, was he right.
			- Now, this **physical direct network effect**, the physical being the copper wires, the physical being these telephones, these heavy black telephones that would sit in people's homes, this was the first commercial network effect discovered and it turns out to be the **strongest network effect** that we know of.
			- The physical is the most powerful, because once you've actually embedded atoms in the ground, like if you're Comcast and you're putting cables to people's homes, or you're AT&T, once you have these physical things in the ground, it's very hard to rip them out.
		- ## Protocol
			- And you can see this with **faxes** or with **ethernet** or with **Bitcoin**, where you develop a protocol, you publish it widely, everyone can now attach to this protocol, and the more people use that protocol, the *more benefit everyone gets* from that protocol.
		- ## Personal utility
			- Where you have your identity, like **WhatsApp**, or like **Facebook** Messenger, or **WeChat**, where it's personal to you, it's direct because I can connect with anyone on WhatsApp, I can connect with anyone on Facebook Messenger, on WeChat, and it's utility, meaning *I get some utility out of it, like making a payment, or picking the kids up from school.*
			- I need to be on that network, I cannot leave that network. That is a *good defensibility*, that is a *good retention* of me and that's what network effects are there to do.
		- ## Personal
			- What **Facebook** has, which is *it's my person, it's my name, it's my picture*, and I've got all my friends, it's a direct network effect, I can see them all, they can see me, I can friend somebody, can unfriend somebody, everything works, but it's not as powerful as the one with utility.
			- When I get sick of being away from Facebook, I'll probably just go back to it, and we see this, people do this all the time, they quit Facebook and then nine months later they say, "I'm back," why? Because you have *this retention, this defensibility, this network effect that adds value to every node on the network,* and no one wants to leave it.
		- ## N-sided marketplace
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1665556899097_0.png)
			- This is also known as an **N-sided marketplace**, but it's still a direct network effect.
			- And basically how it works is, if you have a wedding, let's say, you're going to need a florist, you're going to need a venue, you're going to need a wedding planner, you're going to need a caterer, these are all nodes on a network collaborating on a project, and in the real world they know each other, they connect with each other, but we haven't seen it put in digital format yet so a market network puts it in digital.
			- And once you're on there, once you've got your name and your reputation and your transaction history there, *you're not going to want to leave because it's your source of income, just like a marketplace would be.* But in this case, it's N-sided, everybody in 360 degrees can transact with each other.
	- ## Indirect (cross-side)
		- Now, they **can be attacked**, right? I mean, eBay's been attacked by Amazon marketplace very successfully, by building pro seller tools that were basically better than what eBay had, so people multi-tenanted and moved off, but still these are *very durable network effects*, eBay is still with us, so is Amazon marketplace.
		- ## 2-sided marketplace
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1665557061057_0.png)
			- Very common, whether it's **Craigslist** or **Monster.com** or **Uber**, you've got a supply side and a demand side, *the more supply you have, the more value the demand gets* and vice versa
		- ## Platform
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1665557209783_0.png)
			- A platform *allows businesses to be built on top,* particularly software businesses to be built on top. The best example would be **Microsoft** OS.
			- And you see this now in sort of developer programs that, you know, even these web3 companies want to get developers developing on top of **Ethereum** or on top of **Avalanche**, these are trying to make the network effects be a platform. Same thing happened with **Salesforce**, they had a SaaS tool, they launched Force and said, "This is a platform that you can build your software business on top of, please developers come develop on our platform, you'll be able to get access to distribution, access to your customers through us," and **Salesforce** has done incredibly well.
		- ## Asymptotic marketplace
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1665557421753_0.png)
			- Then you get the asymptotic marketplaces, where like we described before, **Uber** and **Lyft**, their value of their networks *grow very quickly at the beginning, but then as the network size grows, the value doesn't increase that much*, because of the way you consume the value of the marketplace.
			- Meaning you don't want the car coming in more than four minutes, doesn't really help, you still need to go to the bathroom before you get in.
			- We've seen this again with data network effects where it asymptotes, these marketplaces for data asymptote, because the *value doesn't keep increasing as the network size increases* and you see this quite a lot.
		- ## Expertise
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1665557777555_0.png)
			- So because **QuickBooks** got a dominant market share, they were able to then create this network effect so that *employers are looking for people on QuickBooks, and they want to use QuickBooks so that they can always hire new people to work on QuickBooks, to augment whoever else they have, so they have a more liquid pool of labor to work on their accounting. So everyone's incentivized to get good at QuickBooks, to use QuickBooks, and to grow that ecosystem*, which creates great defensibility and retention, which is the definition of network effects. Other examples would include **Figma**, **CAD** software etc.
		- ## Data
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1665558003116_0.png)
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1665558015172_0.png)
			- The idea would be that the more data you get into the system, the more value your system is going to provide to everyone using the product.
			- Now, people think this might be true, and I'll give you a great example of where this does actually work, which is **Waze**. It tracks where you're driving, it can tell the system how fast you're driving, where you're driving, people can note if there's a accident or if there's a police officer or whatever, it's all in the system, and that data is changing all the time, so *once they've established 10 or 30 or 50,000 people using it in a particular city area, you really don't want to go to a different Waze app, a competitor, because you're not going to get the same granularity*, because every 10 minutes or every 20 minutes, the data is worthless, because of changing situation.
			- But generally, it's *hard to use your data to great effect.* People talked about, oh, you know, Netflix knows what you like, Netflix knows what people like. We're going to have these matching algorithms. We're going to have these suggestions algorithms, how much value did that really add to Netflix? *It didn't add that much, even though they made a big deal of it.* We see this in healthcare, we see this in all sorts of algorithms, around logistics, where the data's going to make our product that much more, it can, it can help, it can improve the product experience, but *typically these data network effects aren't as strong as we want to believe, okay? Nevertheless, they are valuable.*
		- ## Tech performance
			- **Bit Torrent**, or a **Skype**, where the idea is *the more people have downloaded the software to their computer and is running it on the network, if it's close to your home, you're going to be able to download a movie faster, or a photo faster, or have better connections* to a conversation you're having, because that bandwidth will be more available to you. So your tech performance actually increases. This *occurs in other mesh networks* where people are doing communications, phone calls.
			- You could even use a *mesh network for, let's say, solar battery charging*. So if you were to have lots of Tesla batteries on your block and they had the same protocol, you could actually share, and the tech performance would increase of all the different batteries and all the different solar panels on your house. I.e. using the batteries in a mesh network as a big *energy buffer and exchanger.*
	- ## Social (human)
		- ## Language
			- If you can get someone to say, "I'm going to **Google** something," it's hard for them to go off and use Bing. If you say, I'm going to grab an **Uber**, it's harder for them to open up the Lyft app, right? So *language can have an impact on retaining people into a network* business that you're running.
		- ## Belief
			- If I believe that **gold** is valuable, even though I can't sleep on it, I can't eat it, I can't build with it, I can't really do much with it, doesn't have that many industrial uses honestly, *if I believe it's valuable, then it's valuable*. And we've been believing it's valuable since recorded history, so we continue to believe it. There's *reasons to believe gold will become valuable in the future and stay valuable, because it's been happening of long*, but it's just belief.
			- Why is **Bitcoin** valuable? Because some people *believe it will be valuable in the future,* I certainly believe it will be, but there's really nothing other than that belief.
			- So you can *create a lot of value with just a belief network effect* and in fact, with Bitcoin and religions and other things, that is the **foundational network effect on top of which all the other network effects are built.**
		- ## Tribal
			- ![image.png](../assets/image_1665559035931_0.png)
			- So these tribes grow, the *more people in those tribes, the more value there is, and people feel very strong about them, in fact, they defend them.* And that's the really unique thing about tribal network effects, is that if someone says, "I'm not using eBay, I'm using Amazon", I'm like, meh.
			- But if someone says, "I don't like the Celtics, I like the New York Knicks", I get upset, I want to fight them, okay? Or the same thing for sororities, fraternities, for universities, right?
			- There's *lots of tribes that we as humans create that become very emotional for us, and will actually cause us to stay inside a network and add more value to that network,* maybe even detract value from another network, so you have network on network violence.
		- ## Bandwagon
			- It's the *sense that humans have about not wanting to be left out.*
			- So **Apple** is the master at creating this fear of being left out, people are waiting in line to get the latest iPhone or whatever, because they want to get on the bandwagon. They don't want to be left behind.
			- **Slack** was very much like this. You know, there was **Hip Chat** well before **Slack**, but **Slack** was cooler, and the companies didn't want to be left behind, you *couldn't be a modern software company if you didn't have your employees using Slack*
		- ## Hub & spoke
			- You would be a node on the **Medium** network by signing up, you would publish into the **hub of Medium** where everyone can see it. And then once a day, *Medium would send out an email* with the best publications of the prior day or the prior few days. Which means that, *instead of your friends seeing what you posted, you might be sent out to **everyone**,* all right?
			- You might get 100,000 visitors if you won the lottery. And then your node, you would *get more attention, you'd get more status, you'd get more money, you'd get more notoriety,* which is what you were trying to get out of writing your post in the first place.
			- Now, this was used by academic journals for hundreds of years, where academics would seek status and notoriety from their peers and maybe an increase in salary, by publishing into the hub, they would look at the hundreds of applications and they would pick two or three or four to publish and then send out to everyone, getting this node a lot of notoriety,

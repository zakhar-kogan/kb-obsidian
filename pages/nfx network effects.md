- # Why network effects are critical
	- https://www.nfx.com/masterclass/network-effects/network-effects-mission-critical
	- Network effects (NE) may be the most important factor in predicting startup's success.
	- Between 2012 and 2018 70% of tech companies employed network effects.

	- Viral effects are ==not== network effects. Network effect is *every user joining the product increases its value for all the other users*, Metcalfe effect.

	- ## Critical mass
		- Or a point of inflection => **crucial** to start getting network effects.
		- So to build the network value, you need to get to critical mass. And what happens is, as your network is growing a little bit, a little bit, a little bit all the time, at some point, it hits a moment of critical mass where it takes off, it lifts off. You can feel it. It's like someone stuck two fingers in your nose and just yanks your head forward. It just starts to take off on its own. And that critical mass moment is often facilitated through **developing your clustering.**
		- Now to get these clusters going, you're going to want to find your minimal viable cluster. Some small group of people that once attached to each other will stay attached to each other that you can then build on. Again, maybe creating another cluster and then bridging those two clusters. That minimal viable cluster really helps you

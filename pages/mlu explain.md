	- logistic regression: a supervised learning algorithm that can be used to classify data into categories, or classes, by predicting the probability that an observation falls into a particular class based on its features.
	- The typical setup for logistic regression is as follows: there is an outcome y*y* that falls into one of two categories (say 0 or 1), and the following equation is used to estimate the probability that y*y* belongs to a particular category given inputs $X = (x_1, x_2, ..., x_k)*X*=(*x*1​,*x*2​,...,*x**k*​):$

	- logistic regression: a supervised learning algorithm that can be used to classify data into categories, or classes, by predicting the probability that an observation falls into a particular class based on its features.
	- The typical setup for logistic regression is as follows: there is an outcome y*y* that falls into one of two categories (say 0 or 1), and the following equation is used to estimate the probability that y*y* belongs to a particular category given inputs $X=(x_1​,x_2​,...,x _k):$

		- This is called a linear predictor, and it is transformed by the sigmoid function so that the values fall between 0 and 1, and can therefore be interpreted as probabilities. This resulting probability is then compared to a threshold to predict a class for **y** based on **X**
	- When fitting our model, the goal is to find the parameters that optimize a function that defines how well the model is performing. Put simply, the goal is to make predictions as close to 1 when the outcome is 1 and as close to 0 when the outcome is 0. In machine learning, the function to be optimized is called the loss function or cost function. We use the loss function to determine how well our model fits the data.
	- A suitable loss function in logistic regression is called the Log-Loss, or binary cross-entropy
